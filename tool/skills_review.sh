# Which shipped skills does this release's diff put in doubt, and why.
#
# `check_skills.dart` answers "does this still compile" — renames, deletions
# and signature changes. It stays green when a symbol survives but changes MEANING, which is
# the failure that actually bit us: getActiveStt(language:) went from a
# load-time property of the recognizer to a per-transcription one, with no
# rename anywhere.
#
# Only reading catches that. This script decides WHAT to read: for each skill it
# lists the API symbols that skill names AND that this diff touched. A skill
# with hits is one you must open; a skill with none you can skip with a clear
# conscience.
#
# Usage, from the repo root:
#   bash tool/skills_review.sh <ref>        # e.g. v1.8.0, or origin/main
#   bash tool/skills_review.sh v1.8.0 HEAD
#
# Exit 0 always — this routes attention, it does not pass or fail.
