// #447 anti-regression: the embeddings/speech loader must not poison the
// process for the LLM path.
//
// Its two companions establish the linker mechanism in the abstract. This one
// exercises the REAL entry point: `LiteRtBindings.open()`, which is what the
// embedding forward pass and every flutter_gemma_speech core call reach for.
// Before the fix it called a plain `DynamicLibrary.open`, and an app that
// embedded or transcribed anything before generating left stream_proxy.c's ABI
// probe permanently blind.
//
// This file is the one that FAILS if the fix is reverted. Run it first in a
// clean process — the property under test is about being first.
//
