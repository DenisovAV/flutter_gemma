/// with that, and none of them are fixed by a bigger `Map`:
///
/// 1. **It does not survive a restart.** Close the app and the index is gone.
///    Re-embedding twelve recipes is a few seconds; re-embedding a real corpus
///    on every cold start is not a thing you can ship.
/// 2. **It costs more memory than you think.** A Dart `double` is a *float64*,
///    so one 768-dimension vector is 768 × 8 = 6 KB — not the 3 KB the model
///    actually emits. Ten thousand documents is 60 MB of Dart heap sitting
///    beside an LLM that already wants a gigabyte or two.
/// 3. **There is nothing to filter on.** "Italian, under 30 minutes" has to
///    happen either before the search (and then it is not a nearest-neighbour
///    search any more) or after it (and then the top-3 can come back empty).
