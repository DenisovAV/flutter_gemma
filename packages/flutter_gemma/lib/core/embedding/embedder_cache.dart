/// The cached embedder, the rule for reusing it, and the serialisation that
/// makes the rule mean anything.
///
/// Each of the three shells (mobile/desktop/web) used to hold this state as its
/// own private fields and re-implement the decision over them. Three copies is
/// three chances to get it wrong, and all three were wrong differently:
///
///  * **mobile** compared the active spec's NAME, so a same-named embedder
///    reinstalled to a new path was served stale; its explicit-paths entry
///    returned the cached model with no comparison at all; and its reuse gate
///    required a field that is only assigned AFTER the build returns, so a
///    second caller arriving mid-build fell through and started a SECOND build,
///    leaving the loser with nobody holding a reference to close it.
///  * **desktop** gated its comparison on that same after-the-build field and
///    then joined any build in flight without comparing anything, so a caller
///    asking for a different model file was handed the one already being built.
///  * **web** was the strictest — it did compare resolved paths — but had no
///    in-flight guard whatsoever, so two concurrent first callers each compiled
///    their own model.
///
/// None of the three identity-guarded its close listener, so a late close of a
/// superseded embedder evicted the live one. One object, one rule; the shells
/// keep the wiring.
///
/// There is deliberately no `Completer` here. Its only job would be to let a
/// concurrent caller join a build already in flight, which [serialize] makes
/// impossible — and a completer that outlives its build is a hang waiting to
/// happen: any throw between installing it and entering the enclosing `try`
/// leaves every later caller awaiting something nobody will ever complete.
