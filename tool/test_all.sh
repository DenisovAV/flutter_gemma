#!/usr/bin/env bash
# test_all.sh — run every workspace package's tests, from the package's own dir.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# `flutter test` at the repo root tests nothing: the workspace root has no
# test/ directory. Pointing it at a package (`flutter test packages/<pkg>`)
# runs from the WRONG working directory — several suites read fixtures through
# paths relative to the package root (flutter_gemma_agent's
# test/fixtures/skills/*.SKILL.md), and 20 of them fail on a missing file.
#
# Until 2026-08-18 CI ran only packages/flutter_gemma, leaving 97 of the repo's
# 169 test files unexercised — all 46 in speech, all 14 in agent — while those
# packages publish to pub.dev independently, each under its own version.
#
# Packages are DISCOVERED, never listed. A hardcoded list is how a new
# satellite ends up shipping untested: it simply never appears in the run.
# Every workspace package is reported as either tested or having no test/
# directory, and a run that discovers nothing fails rather than reporting
# success — a check that examined nothing is not a check that passed.
#
# Usage:
#   tool/test_all.sh              # all packages
#   tool/test_all.sh --coverage   # plus lcov for flutter_gemma (what CI does)
#
# Exit: 0 all green · 1 any package failed, or nothing was discovered.

# SqliteVectorStore resolves its vec0 loadable through Native Assets — on macOS
# that is `vec0.framework/vec0`, which exists only inside a built app, never
# under `flutter test` on the host. The store already honours $VEC0_DYLIB as an
# override (see `_resolveVec0Path`) and a maintainer usually has a local
# prebuilt, so point at it when one is there.
#
# The SUITES no longer need this: they call useHostNativeLibraries() (see
# rag_sqlite/test/vec0_locator.dart), which hands the store its path through the
# same programmatic override qdrant always had, from the same shared locator in
# core. A plain `flutter test` in that package now works with no environment at
# all. The export stays because the opt-in benchmark still reads it, and
# dropping it would silently turn that off.
#
# History worth keeping: those store tests used to SKIP, gated on $VEC0_DYLIB
# being set — which it never was — so a suite that had never once executed
# looked exactly like a suite that passed.

# NOTE: the cross-backend parity suite needs no wiring here. qdrant-edge's
# library is DOWNLOADED by a Native Assets hook and `flutter test` runs hooks,
# so it is already on disk by the time the suite opens a store. Since
# flutter_gemma_rag_qdrant 2.0.0 that hook belongs to the official `qdrant_edge`
# SDK — the package carries no hook/ and no native/ of its own, and there is no
# locator file to point at. An earlier draft exported $QDRANT_DYLIB from a cargo
# target directory and told CI to build Rust; that was solving a problem the
# hook had already solved.

# NOTE, so nobody re-adds it: an earlier revision of this script excluded
# flutter_gemma_speech's `qwen3-artifacts` tag whenever the HuggingFace model
# snapshot was absent, on the assumption that those suites would otherwise fail
# in CI. That assumption was never tested and is false — the suites check for
# the snapshot themselves and call markTestSkipped. Measured with
# QWEN3_MODEL_DIR=/definitely/not/here: exit 0, 52 passed, 14 skipped, 0 failed.
#
# The exclusion therefore fixed no failure, replaced 14 itemised skips with
# invisible non-runs, and silenced 9 suites that execute perfectly well without
# artifacts. Removed. Let the suites decide; they already know how.
