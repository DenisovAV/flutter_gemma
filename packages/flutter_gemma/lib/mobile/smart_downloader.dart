  ///     jobs "shouldn't be used for long pieces of work". Expedited work also
  ///     draws on a separate 24-hour budget.
  ///   * it currently hangs the download outright. WorkManager caps a task at 9
  ///     minutes; background_downloader survives that by pausing and
  ///     RE-ENQUEUING with `initialDelayMillis = 1000`. The re-enqueue sets
  ///     `setInitialDelay` and, below priority 5, `setExpedited` on the same
  ///     builder, and `WorkRequest.Builder.build()` throws
