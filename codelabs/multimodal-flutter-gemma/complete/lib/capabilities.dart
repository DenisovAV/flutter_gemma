/// it. A single `bool canSendAudio` cannot do that: it collapses two
/// independent facts into one, and the user is left staring at a greyed-out
/// microphone with no idea whether the app is broken, the model is wrong, or
/// this is simply not a place where audio works.
///
/// Two questions, not every question. A third axis — this particular device,
/// and what its memory and hardware will actually stand — is deliberately out
/// of scope: an old phone or an iOS Simulator answers yes to both of these and
/// can still crawl or run out of memory, and the app finds that out from a load
/// error instead. A fourth (the microphone permission) is asked at the moment
/// of use in `chat_page.dart`, because unlike these two it can change while the
/// app is running. Copy this type by all means — but do not read it as the
/// complete list of reasons a modality can fail.
