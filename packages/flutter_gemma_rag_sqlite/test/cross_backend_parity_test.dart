// One filter, one document set, two stores — the same answer, or a failure.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
//
// The two RAG backends are supposed to be interchangeable: `VectorStoreRepository`
// promises the same `Filter` means the same thing on sqlite-vec/vec0 and on
// qdrant-edge. Three review passes over PR #442 found nine ways that was false,
// and every one of them was invisible to the tests that existed, for one reason:
//
//   the tests compared each codec's OUTPUT to a string in the same file.
//
// `filter_to_vec0_test.dart` asserts generated SQL. `filter_codec_test.dart`
// asserts JSON shape. Both are restatements of their own implementation, so a
// codec and its test can be wrong together and stay green forever — and both
// were. Worse, neither package's tests could even see the other backend, so
// "parity" was a word in a group name, not a thing being checked.
//
// This file asserts on ROWS returned by both REAL stores. It cannot pass by
// agreeing with a comment.
//
// HOW BOTH BACKENDS GET HERE
//
// qdrant-edge needs no local Rust build and no environment variable. Its
// native library arrives via the official `qdrant_edge` SDK's own Native
// Assets build hook — this package dev-depends on rag_qdrant, so `flutter
// test` here resolves it like any other native asset, exactly like LiteRT's.
// There is no override to set: QdrantVectorStore opens straight from the
// asset the hook registered.
//
// vec0 is the one that still needs $VEC0_DYLIB, because SqliteVectorStore
// resolves it as `vec0.framework/vec0` — a path that exists only inside a built
// app. tool/test_all.sh exports it; vec0_locator.dart is the gate.
//
// If qdrant does NOT initialize, this file fails rather than skipping. That is
// the point: three review passes found nine cross-backend defects, every one of
// them invisible because no test ran both stores, and a suite that silently
// checks half of what it claims is the very defect it exists to catch.
//
