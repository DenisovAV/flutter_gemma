/// Establishes two facts about the `.litertlm` web path on `@litert-lm/core`
/// 0.17.0 that the docs and the code currently disagree about:
///
/// Split out of web_probe_test.dart: there, this ran second, on a model whose
/// singleton session had already been used by a function-calling chat that was
/// never closed. After tools started reaching the session, this test changed
/// failure mode from "no ThinkingResponse" to "Invalid token at state 37" —
/// which could be the thinking path itself or leakage from the previous chat.
/// One test per file removes that ambiguity.
///
/// Both assertions below are written OPTIMISTICALLY on purpose: `print` output
/// is unreliable under `flutter drive`, but the text of a failed `expect` always
/// reaches the log. So a pass means the capability works, and a failure prints
/// what actually came back instead. Either outcome is the answer.
