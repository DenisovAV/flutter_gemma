/// Budget-gates a paid [premium] branch against an app-supplied signal, falling

/// spend, per-session cap, daily quota) and reduces it to one bool; this
/// package depends on no billing SDK.
///
/// While the budget holds, returns `[premium, cheap]` — premium, with the free
/// branch as a transient-failure fallback (premium can fail and fall through to
/// free; there is nothing to fall back to from free, so a spent budget returns
/// `[cheap]` alone). A request-aware cost *estimator* is a deferred, different
/// strategy — keep the signal a bare `bool Function()`.
