#!/usr/bin/env bash
# export_codelabs.sh — claat export, plus everything that must hold about its
# output before the result is allowed near a deploy.
#
# Called from website/deploy.sh, .github/workflows/firebase-hosting-merge.yml
# and .github/workflows/website-build-check.yml. All three used to carry their
# own copy of the export loop; that is why this file exists. The merge workflow
# deploys the live site and the build-check workflow is the PR gate, so a fix
# landed in deploy.sh alone was undone by the next merge, and a fix landed in
# both workflows was still never exercised before merge.
#
# WHY ANY OF THIS
#
# claat hardcodes https://storage.googleapis.com/claat-public/ for four scripts
# and the one stylesheet a codelab page has. That bucket began answering 403
# ("UserProjectAccountProblem — the billing account for the owning project is
# disabled in state absent"), and every published codelab lost its CSS *and* its
# JS: the <google-codelab-step> elements never upgrade and nothing hides the
# inactive ones, so all steps render stacked, unstyled, with no navigation.
#
# Nothing went red. The build was green, the deploy succeeded, the HTML was
# served. Only a human opening the page could tell. That is the failure mode
# this script exists to make impossible, which is why its checks are written as
# properties of the output rather than as the absence of yesterday's symptom:
#
#   * every resource a page loads is ours or explicitly allowed — NOT merely
#     "the string claat-public is gone". A claat upgrade that emitted a
#     different remote origin would sail through the second check and fail the
#     first, which is the whole point.
#   * every asset a page references exists — NOT merely "these five filenames
#     exist". A sixth asset under the same prefix would be rewritten to a URL
#     nobody serves, swapping a 403 for a 404.
#   * every vendored asset matches its recorded sha256 — existence is not
#     integrity; a truncated or emptied file passes a file test and breaks the
#     page exactly like the outage did.
#
# The page checks run in one python pass on purpose. `grep` as a predicate
# cannot distinguish "found nothing" from "could not read the file" — both are
# non-zero — so a guard built on it folds its own failure into the success
# branch. python either asserts, or raises; there is no third outcome.
#
# Two riders live here because they are the same edit:
#
#   * -ga "" blanks claat's default UA-49880327-14, the Google Codelabs team's
#     own Universal Analytics property. We were sending our readers' page views
#     to a third party, to a property dead since UA stopped processing data in
#     July 2023, and receiving nothing.
#   * the codelabs are added to sitemap.xml. `jaspr build --sitemap-domain` can
#     only enumerate Jaspr routes, and these are static claat output.
#
# Usage, from the website/ directory:
#   tool/export_codelabs.sh
#
#   CLAAT=/path/to/claat   override the binary (CI downloads a SHA-pinned one)
#   DOMAIN=https://…       sitemap origin; MUST match --sitemap-domain
