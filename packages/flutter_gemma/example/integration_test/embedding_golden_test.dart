// Golden-vector baseline for the embedder decoupling refactor (embedder
// decoupling plan Task 1 / I0 checkpoint).
//
// Captures a fixed set of embeddings on the PRE-refactor tree
// (`packages/flutter_gemma_embeddings` LiteRT-backed) into a checked-in JSON
// golden file, then on every subsequent run asserts the current SDK produces
// bit-for-bit (or ≤1e-6 per-component) identical vectors. This is the only
// test that can catch a silently-added normalization/pooling step on the
// LiteRT path — cosine-similarity tests are scale-invariant and would not
// notice an added L2-normalize.
//
// Capture procedure (must be run on the PRE-refactor tree, deliberately,
// not by CI):
//   git stash -u                     # park the refactor
//   cd packages/flutter_gemma/example && flutter pub get
//   flutter test integration_test/embedding_golden_test.dart -d macos
//   # test FAILS (by design) and writes the candidate golden to
//   # integration_test/goldens/embedding_golden.json — inspect it, then:
//   git add integration_test/goldens/embedding_golden.json
//   git stash pop                    # restore the refactor, re-run to assert
//
// A missing golden file is a FAILING test, not a passing "capture mode" —
// see the `fail(...)` call below. This is deliberate: a naive CI run on a
// tree with no committed baseline must never bless its own output as the
// golden. Every run after the file is committed asserts against it.
