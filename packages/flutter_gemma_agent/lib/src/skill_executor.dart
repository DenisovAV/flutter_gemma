///
/// One executor per skill mechanism (text-only persona, sandboxed JS, native
/// OS intent, MCP tool call). [SkillExecutor] `implements` the core
/// [SkillExecutorProvider] contract, so the very same instances can be:
///
///  1. registered through core via
///     `FlutterGemma.initialize(skillExecutors: [JsSkillExecutor(), …])`
///     (the recommended path — they land in core's `SkillExecutorRegistry`,
///     which `AgentSession.fromModel` reads when no explicit list is passed),
///     or
///  2. passed directly to `AgentSession.fromModel(executors: […])`.
///
/// Either way selection is a probe-chain exactly like `InferenceEngineProvider`:
/// the registered executor with the highest [priority] whose [canExecute] is
/// true wins (first-registered breaks ties). There is NO central type→executor
/// map — a third-party executor self-selects with zero changes elsewhere.
///
/// Core probes by the kebab-case type id ([canExecute] takes a `String`,
/// satisfying [SkillExecutorProvider]); inside the package use the type-safe
/// [canExecuteSkill] / [SkillType] check. The default [canExecute] bridges the
/// two via [SkillTypeId], so concrete executors only override [canExecuteSkill].
