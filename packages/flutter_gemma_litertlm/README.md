# flutter_gemma_litertlm

LiteRT-LM (`.litertlm`) on-device inference engine for [flutter_gemma](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_gemma),
via `dart:ffi`. Opt-in package — add it only if you run `.litertlm` models.
Android, iOS, macOS, Linux, Windows.

This package **owns** the shared LiteRT-LM native library (`libLiteRtLm`) and
exposes the LiteRt interpreter FFI (`LiteRtBindings`); both are shared by
[flutter_gemma_speech](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_gemma_speech). As of
1.5.0 this package also ships the LiteRT C API embedding backend
(`LiteRtEmbeddingBackend`) — see [Embeddings](#embeddings) below — over the
runtime-agnostic embedding pipeline in `flutter_gemma`. Tokenizers come from
[flutter_gemma_embeddings](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_gemma_embeddings),
which the app registers; this package does not depend on it.

Installs the agent skills `flutter_gemma` bundles — this package depends on it, so they come with it. One of them, `flutter-gemma-inference`, covers the `.litertlm` engine, installing a model from Hugging Face, sessions, streaming, and the platform setup for all six targets.

## Usage

```dart
import 'package:flutter_gemma/flutter_gemma.dart';
import 'package:flutter_gemma_litertlm/flutter_gemma_litertlm.dart';

await FlutterGemma.initialize(
  inferenceEngines: [LiteRtLmEngine()],
);
```

`LiteRtLmEngine` handles `ModelFileType.litertlm` models; pass it alongside
other engines (e.g. `MediaPipeEngine` from `flutter_gemma_mediapipe`) if your app
uses both formats.

## Install from a Hugging Face repo (`litertlm_manifest.json`)

Repos that ship a
[`litertlm_manifest.json`](https://github.com/john-rocky/hf-to-litertlm/blob/main/manifest/SCHEMA.md)
deployment manifest describe every `.litertlm` file they contain — which
backends each is verified on, which file a given platform should pick, sha256/
size identity, and session guidance. `LitertlmManifestResolver` reads it so an
app installs "the right file for this device" without hardcoding filenames:

```dart
import 'dart:math' show max;

// LiteRtLmEngine carries this resolver, so registering the engine registers
// it too. Pass huggingFaceResolvers: only to override — e.g.
// [LitertlmManifestResolver(revision: 'abc123')] to pin a commit.
await FlutterGemma.initialize(inferenceEngines: [LiteRtLmEngine()]);

final r = await FlutterGemma.resolveHuggingFace(
    'litert-community/Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507',
    fileType: ModelFileType.litertlm);
await FlutterGemma.installModel(
      modelType: r.modelType ?? ModelType.general,
      fileType: r.fileType,
    )
    .fromNetwork(r.url) // authoritative: carries the resolver's revision pin
    .install();
final model = await FlutterGemma.getActiveModel(defaults: r.runtime);
final session = await model.createSession(
  enableThinking: r.runtime.isThinking ?? false,
  // minOutputTokens is a floor, not a cap: keep the app's own budget unless
  // the manifest asks for more.
  maxOutputTokens: max(1024, r.runtime.minOutputTokens ?? 0),
);
```

Everything the manifest returns is an overridable default (explicit argument >
manifest > SDK default); `r.notes` carries platform caveats and known issues
worth surfacing to developers. Repos without a manifest keep working through
`installModel(...).fromHuggingFace(repo, file: ...)`.

To resolve and install in one step, omit `file`: `fromHuggingFace(repo)` reads
the manifest at install time, installs the revision-pinned variant, and returns
the same defaults on `InferenceInstallation.runtime` (plus `notes`). The
two-step form above stays the offline-safe one — manifest mode needs the network
on every install, because the variant's filename is only known after the fetch.

## Embeddings

```dart
await FlutterGemma.initialize(
  embeddingBackends: [LiteRtEmbeddingBackend()],
);
```

`LiteRtEmbeddingBackend` runs Gecko / EmbeddingGemma `.tflite` models via the
LiteRT C API. The pipeline it plugs into — the forward-pass seam, the worker
isolate and the pooling — lives in `flutter_gemma`; the tokenizers come from
`flutter_gemma_embeddings`, which your app registers via
`embeddingTokenizers:`. This package depends on neither beyond core.
On web it runs via LiteRT.js instead; see
[Embeddings on web](#embeddings-on-web) below for the four files and the
`<script>` tag your app needs.

## Embeddings on web

On web, `flutter_gemma_litertlm`'s embedding backend runs via LiteRT.js. Copy
all four files from this package's `web/` into your app's `web/`, next to
`index.html` — `litert_embeddings.js` imports the other three by relative path,
so they have to sit together:

```
litert_embeddings.js  sentencepiece.js  litert.js  tensorflow.js
```

They are four pieces of one bundle (the entry plus three vendor chunks), built
together by `tool/web_build`, so never mix them across package versions. Find
this package's directory with
`grep -A1 '"name": "flutter_gemma_litertlm"' .dart_tool/package_config.json`,
then load the entry module from `web/index.html`:

```html
<script type="module" src="litert_embeddings.js"></script>
```

Upgrading from an earlier version: delete the copies in your app's `web/` and
re-copy all four from this package. Before 1.8.0 they came from
`flutter_gemma_embeddings`, and the copies you have are built against an older
`@litertjs/core` than the runtime this version loads. If you built your own
`web/wasm/`, either delete it and take the CDN default or rebuild it from the
version in `LiteRtWebRuntime.pinnedVersion`.

> Loading `litert_embeddings.js` straight from a CDN with a
> Subresource-Integrity hash — which an older README suggested — cannot work:
> the module's three imports resolve against the CDN path, where they do not
> exist, so the module never executes and every embedding call fails on an
> undefined global. SRI would not have covered the imports either.

### The WASM runtime

LiteRT.js loads a WASM runtime at the first embedding call —
`litert_wasm_internal.js`, or `litert_wasm_compat_internal.js` on a browser
without relaxed SIMD, each with a ~9 MB `.wasm` beside it. Since 1.8.0 they come
from the pinned `@litertjs/core` build on jsDelivr by default — nothing to
install, and nothing this package has to carry into every native-only app.

To serve them yourself (offline, an air-gapped deploy, or a CSP that forbids
third-party script), copy `node_modules/@litertjs/core/wasm/` into your app's
`web/wasm/` and point the package at it before the first embedding:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_gemma_litertlm/flutter_gemma_litertlm.dart';

LiteRtWebRuntime.wasmPath = '/wasm/';
```

Those files come from `@litertjs/core` — `npm i @litertjs/core@2.5.3` in a
scratch directory, then copy its `wasm/`.

Set the prefix before the first embedding — the runtime is loaded once and
cached, so a later assignment is ignored. LiteRT.js inserts the separator when
it joins the prefix with the file name, so the trailing slash above is
convention, not a requirement; the value is root-absolute, and an app served
under a base href other than `/` needs `/my-app/wasm/` or a full URL.

Pin `@litertjs/core` to `LiteRtWebRuntime.pinnedVersion` if you vendor it. The
runtime and this package's `web/litert.js` are two halves of one release —
`litert.js` calls that release's WASM entry points by name — and a mismatch
fails at the first embedding with something that does not mention versions at
all: a runtime older than the glue gives
`Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'create')`.

Serving it yourself is also the answer if a third-party script in your app's
runtime path is not acceptable to you: LiteRT.js injects the `<script>` itself,
so the CDN copy carries no Subresource-Integrity hash.

Whatever host you use must send `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` (LiteRT.js sets
`crossOrigin="anonymous"` on the script it injects) and serve `.wasm` as
`application/wasm`.

Native platforms need no setup — the LiteRT native library is bundled at build
time by `flutter_gemma_litertlm`'s Native-Assets hook.

## Web setup (early preview)

`.litertlm` web inference runs via `@litert-lm/core` (WebGPU/WASM, text-only).
`createSession(maxOutputTokens:)` is honoured here as it is on native. Earlier
releases of this package accepted the argument and logged that it was ignored.
Add the handshake below to your app's `web/index.html` `<head>` — the ESM doesn't
assign window globals and module scripts are deferred, so Dart awaits
`window.litertLmReady` (which resolves to the `Engine` constructor):

```html
<script type="module">
window.litertLmReady = (async () => {
  const m = await import('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@litert-lm/core@0.17.0/+esm');
  window.Engine = m.Engine;
  return m.Engine;
})();
</script>
```

Native platforms need no web setup.

## Platforms

| Platform | Support |
|----------|---------|
| Android  | ✅ FFI (GPU via OpenCL, NPU via `.litertlm` on Qualcomm) |
| iOS      | ✅ FFI (GPU via Metal on device; CPU on simulator) |
| macOS / Linux | ✅ FFI (GPU via Metal / Vulkan) |
| Windows  | ✅ FFI (CPU + GPU via DirectX 12 + Intel NPU) |
| Web      | ✅ via `@litert-lm/core` (CDN, early preview) |

> **Fixed in 1.4.0:** Windows **discrete GPUs** crashed on
> `PreferredBackend.gpu` in 1.2.0–1.3.1. Upgrade to 1.4.0; on the affected
> versions use `PreferredBackend.cpu` or `.npu`. macOS/Linux GPU and Windows
> CPU/NPU were never affected.

The native library is fetched at build time by `hook/build.dart` (Native Assets)
from a SHA256-verified GitHub release — no manual setup on native platforms.

## Troubleshooting

### Google Play rejects the app over 16 KB page sizes (fixed in 1.8.0)

Symptom: Play Console refuses the release with *"Your app does not support
16 KB memory page sizes"*, on any app that depends on this package. Nothing
fails at build or run time — the rejection happens at submission.

Cause: the Qualcomm Hexagon DSP blobs this package bundles for the NPU path
(`libQnnHtpV{73,75,79,81}Skel.so`) arrive from the QAIRT SDK with a 4 KB
`p_align`, and they ship in every APK because the NPU libraries are bundled
unconditionally. Play scans `lib/**/*.so` and does not care that a Hexagon
image is loaded by the DSP rather than mapped by the kernel.

Fix: upgrade to 1.8.0. Check your own build with Google's
`check_elf_alignment.sh` against the APK, not against this package.

### Any tool call kills the app (fixed in 1.7.1)

Symptom: in 1.7.0, a chat or session created with `tools` dies on the first
decoded token — `EXC_BAD_ACCESS` / `SIGSEGV` inside the runtime, on every
platform, CPU and GPU alike. Dart sees no exception; `flutter test` reports only
that the test did not complete. Generation without tools is unaffected.

Cause: constrained decoding is implemented by a prebuilt companion,
`libGemmaModelConstraintProvider`, that ships with the LiteRT-LM release.
Upstream replaced the `Constraint` interface, and the companion published at tag
v0.17.0 still implements the old one, so the runtime we build calls into the
wrong vtable slot.

Fix: upgrade to 1.7.1, which pins the native bundle `native-v0.17.0-a` — the same
runtime with the companion rebuilt from upstream main. FunctionGemma also needs
`flutter_gemma` 1.8.4: 1.7.1 sends the tool result as a role-`tool` message, and
core decides that it should.

### Windows: embeddings or speech fail with `status=3` (fixed in 1.7.0)

Symptom: on Windows only, `LiteRtEmbeddingBackend` and `flutter_gemma_speech`
fail with `LiteRT call failed: CreateTensorBufferFromHostMemory(...) (status=3)`
in 1.4.0–1.6.4. Text generation is unaffected.

Cause: LiteRT made `LiteRtLayout` one layout on every compiler; this package
still wrote tensor shapes in the old MSVC layout on Windows.

Fix: upgrade to 1.7.0 (and `flutter_gemma_speech` to 0.5.1).

### Garbled or empty streams on Android (fixed in 1.5.2)

Symptom: a generation delivers zero chunks and throws
`Exception: Stream error: <U+FFFD>`, often followed by
`Callback invoked after it has been deleted` and a `SIGABRT` that Dart cannot
catch.

Cause: on Android the first `dlopen` of `libLiteRtLm` decides, for the whole
process, whether its exports are reachable from the default symbol search
scope, and bionic never promotes an already-loaded library afterwards. Before
1.5.2 the embeddings and speech entry point opened it locally, so an app that
embedded or transcribed anything before its first generation left the
stream-callback ABI probe unable to see the library — and the probe read that
as "old library" and registered the wrong callback shape.

Fix: upgrade to 1.5.2. If you load `libLiteRtLm` yourself from app or
third-party code, load it before flutter_gemma does and with `RTLD_GLOBAL`.
1.5.2 cannot repair that case — bionic never promotes an already-loaded library
— but it no longer generates corrupt text: a `.litertlm` generation raises a
`StateError` naming the condition, and embeddings or speech (which resolve
through their own handle and do not need the symbols to be ambient) log a
warning and carry on.
See [#447](https://github.com/DenisovAV/flutter_gemma/issues/447).

### `dlopen` / "library not found" (`libLiteRtLm`)

`flutter_gemma_litertlm` is the sole owner of the shared native library
(`libLiteRtLm`) and bundles it via its build hook — this package's own
`LiteRtEmbeddingBackend` and `flutter_gemma_speech` both use it directly. A
stale Native-Assets cache after a
native version bump can leave the library unbundled, surfacing as an opaque
`dlopen` "no such file" on the first inference. Fix with a clean rebuild:

```bash
flutter clean
rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/flutter_gemma/native        # macOS
rm -rf ~/.cache/flutter_gemma/native                # Linux
# Windows: rmdir /s "%LOCALAPPDATA%\flutter_gemma\native"  (path may vary)
flutter pub get
```
