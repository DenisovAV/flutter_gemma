"""Block `dart pub publish` of a package whose code changed but whose docs did not.

Why this exists: twice in one session a package was released with the code shipped
but the docs skipped — agent 0.2.3 published without its pub.dev README updated
(had to ship 0.2.4 the same day), and the 1.5.9 vision-backend docs were split off
into a separate website PR instead of riding the release PR. The `release` skill
says docs (Step 12: version pins + new-API docs) are MANDATORY ON EVERY RELEASE and
"commit the website/ changes on your release branch / PR" (one PR, not two). The
skill was read and the docs were still deferred — which is the argument for a hook
over more prose: a checklist advises, a hook refuses. (Same lesson as
guard-publish.py.)

Blocks a real publish (not --dry-run) of package X when, in the commit range that
introduced X's current `version:` (that commit .. HEAD), X's `lib/` changed but
its own pub.dev-facing `README.md` did NOT. The README specifically — a
`website/content/docs/` edit is deliberately NOT accepted as a substitute:
website docs aren't package-scoped, so a sibling package's website change (batch
release) or a website-only-but-README-skipped change (the agent 0.2.3 miss this
hook was built for) would otherwise pass. website/README both belong in the
release, but only README is enforceable per-package here; the Step-12b website
docs are enforced by review + the DoD checklist.

The package is located from the directory the publish RUNS IN, and every git
question is asked of THAT repository. Both used to come from $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR
plus a hardcoded `packages/<name>` layout, which meant this hook could not see a
single-package repo at all (it refused, having no idea what was being published)
and, working from a second checkout, would have asked its questions of the wrong
repository. A package that is its own repo is the ordinary case outside this
monorepo, so `packages/<name>` is now one shape rather than the only one.

This range/boundary logic is only exact when HEAD == the release commit — which is
always true when this PreToolUse hook actually fires (at publish time).
It is NOT a general retroactive audit.

Override for a genuine code-only release with no README surface (rare) by putting
`RELEASE_SKIP_DOCS=<reason>` in the command.

Fail-closed: if git can't be consulted, or the package/version can't be resolved,
BLOCK — an irreversible publish in an unknown state is not a safe one.

Exit 0 allows, exit 2 blocks with the reason on stderr.
Run `python3 guard-release-docs.py --self-test` to check the matching rules.
