# Stage the upstream Apple companion dylibs into a built macOS .app.
#
# hook/build.dart deliberately skips these from Native Assets on macOS (#247):
# the three dylibs Google ships (libGemmaModelConstraintProvider.dylib,
# libLiteRtMetalAccelerator.dylib, libLiteRtTopKMetalSampler.dylib) were linked
# without -Wl,-headerpad_max_install_names, so Native Assets' JIT path aborts
# rewriting their install_name to a long absolute path. Nothing else stages
# them, so this script does — and patches LiteRtLm's own reference to match.
#
# Called from the app's macos/Podfile `post_install` build phase. Kept as a
# standalone script so the logic has ONE home (it used to be copy-pasted into
# every example Podfile and the README) and so it can be tested without an
# Xcode build.
#
# Usage:
#   stage_macos_companions.sh <frameworks_dir> [source_dir]
#
#   frameworks_dir  the app's Contents/Frameworks
#   source_dir      where the lib*.dylib companions live; when omitted, the
#                   Native Assets cache is used, then an in-repo prebuilt/.
