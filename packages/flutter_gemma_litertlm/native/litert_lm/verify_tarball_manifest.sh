# verify_tarball_manifest.sh — release gate that catches DROPPED native files.
#
# THE BUG THIS PREVENTS (native-v0.13.1, 1.0.0): rebuilding native for a new
# LiteRT-LM version silently shipped WITHOUT the manually-built NPU add-on
# stacks — android lost 11 Qualcomm/QNN libs, windows lost 12 Intel OpenVino/
# TBB files. `PreferredBackend.npu` broke on both. Nothing caught it: the
# release skill's "dylibs changed?" step diffs a GITIGNORED prebuilt/ dir, and
# the FFI gate only exercises GPU/CPU, never NPU. So the only safety net is
# comparing the NEW tarball's file-list against the LAST PUBLISHED tag.
#
# What it does: for every litertlm-<plat>.tar.gz you are about to publish, it
# downloads the same archive from the previous tag and DIFFS the file lists.
# Any file present in the old tag but MISSING in the new one is a hard FAIL
# (exit 1) — unless explicitly allow-listed via INTENTIONAL_DROPS.
#
# Usage:
#   ./verify_tarball_manifest.sh <DIST_DIR> <PREV_TAG>
#   ./verify_tarball_manifest.sh "$DIST" native-v0.13.1
#
# Intentional removals (e.g. you really meant to drop a lib) go in
# INTENTIONAL_DROPS below, one "plat:filename" per line, with a comment saying
# why. An empty/default list means "nothing may disappear".
