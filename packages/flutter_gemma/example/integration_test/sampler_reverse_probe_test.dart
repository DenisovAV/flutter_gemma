/// Falsification probe for the #2080 diagnosis — NOT a regression test.

/// sampler_baking_2080_test.dart concludes "the engine bakes whatever its first
/// generation used". That conclusion makes a prediction that has nothing to do
/// with greedy being a special case, and this file tests it:
///
///   Engine D, FIRST session STOCHASTIC (topK 64, temp 1.5, seed 7)  -> S
///   Engine D, LATER session GREEDY     (topK 1,  temp 0.8, seed 1)  -> Gd
///
///   baking real      : Gd == S   (locked to the stochastic first generation)
///   baking not real  : Gd == G   (the greedy text a fresh greedy engine gives)
///
/// The two outcomes are mutually exclusive and both are observable, so this
/// cannot come back "inconclusive" the way a single-direction test can. If Gd
/// comes out equal to the known greedy text, the baking diagnosis is wrong and
/// the docs' "honored natively" claim is right.
///
