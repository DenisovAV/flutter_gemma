/// Native-only RAG vector store backed by the official `qdrant_edge` SDK.
/// Implements
/// flutter_gemma's [VectorStoreRepository]. Its HNSW index makes it the fastest
/// native option — roughly 5–11× faster search than the in-SQLite sqlite-vec
/// store at 1k–10k docs (with identical top-K results). Web is unsupported
/// (qdrant-edge can't compile to WASM); use flutter_gemma_rag_sqlite there.
///
/// Public API parity with the existing contract:
///
/// * `String id` continues to be the user-facing identifier. Internally
///   each id is mapped to a stable UUIDv5 via [PointIdHasher] and stored
///   alongside the document content in the qdrant payload so that
///   [searchSimilar] returns the original String back without a sidecar
///   mapping table.
/// * `addDocument`'s `metadata` is still a JSON string. We do **not**
///   parse it eagerly — we forward the raw string into the payload under
///   the key `metadata`. Filtering by metadata fields therefore requires
///   that callers pass valid JSON; this matches the existing constraint.
/// * `enableHnsw` is accepted but ignored — qdrant decides indexing
///   internally based on its `indexing_threshold` (~20k points). Below
///   that it brute-forces a plain segment, which is already faster than
///   our Dart HNSW for typical RAG corpora.
///
/// Distance defaults to cosine, matching the historical behaviour.
///
/// ### On-disk layout
///
/// The store owns a bounded, format-scoped subdirectory —
/// `databasePath/qdrant_edge_v1` — created on first write, and that is the only
/// shard it ever opens. This means:
///
///   * a shard written by 1.x (crate 0.7.x) sits at the bare `databasePath` and
///     is never opened, so there is no partial-open or WAL-corruption risk from
///     mixing engine versions. It is not ignored either: [initialize] refuses
///     it with a [QdrantLegacyStoreException] rather than letting the store
///     come up silently empty over a populated index;
///   * [clear] never deletes a file. It empties the shard in place through the
///     SDK, so the directory survives and the store stays usable — and when a
///     1.x layout is present it refuses outright rather than removing data it
///     cannot read. Nothing the caller keeps alongside the store is ever
///     touched, by this package or by anything it tells the caller to do.
