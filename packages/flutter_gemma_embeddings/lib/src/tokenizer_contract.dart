/// What it catches, precisely: a release where those two methods stop clearing
/// the config they name — deprecated to no-ops, or refactored to return a new
/// instance while leaving the receiver untouched (the `..` cascade discards the
/// copy, so the original stays configured and this sees it). A RENAME instead
/// fails at compile time, which is why this only has to cover the silent shapes.
///
/// What it does NOT catch: a release that pads or truncates through some THIRD
/// field, leaving both of these null. Nothing here can see that — only a
/// behavioural assertion on `encode()`'s output can, which is what
/// `test/siglip_loader_contract_test.dart` is for. The two are complementary,
/// and neither subsumes the other.
