// Qwen3-TTS language-id map + the public supported-language list.
//
// Single source of truth for THREE consumers that must never drift apart:
//  - `Qwen3Prompt.build` (`qwen3_prompt.dart`), which maps a language name to
//    its control-token id for the talker prompt (Task 1.4/5.1).
//  - `LiteRtSpeechSynthesizer.create`'s create-time language validator
//    (Task 5.4) — fails loud with an `ArgumentError` for an unknown language
//    BEFORE spawning the ~1.9 GB `TtsWorker`, rather than deep inside the
//    worker isolate on the first `synthesize` call.
//  - the example's language picker (`tts_screen.dart`), which populates its
//    dropdown from [qwen3SupportedLanguages] instead of hardcoding a second
//    copy of the list.
//
// This file is deliberately dependency-free (no imports at all, not even
// `dart:typed_data`) so it is safe to export UNCONDITIONALLY from the
// package barrel, including on platforms without `dart:io`/`dart:ffi`
// (`qwen3_prompt.dart` itself pulls in `qwen3_tables.dart`, which uses
// `dart:io` — that stays package-private).
