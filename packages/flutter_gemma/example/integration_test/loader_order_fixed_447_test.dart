// #447, half two: the CORRECT order.
//
// Its companion (loader_order_447_test.dart) shows that a plain
// DynamicLibrary.open first leaves the ABI probe blind, and that loading
// globally afterwards does not repair it. That rules out every "repair"
// strategy and leaves only prevention — so the fix must guarantee the FIRST
// open is the global one.
//
// This file asks whether that guarantee is sufficient: once the library is in
// the process with RTLD_GLOBAL, does a later plain open take it back out of
// the default search scope? If it does, ordering alone cannot fix #447 and
// every load path has to be converted. If it does not, the fix is a Dart-side
// ordering change with no native rebuild.
//
// MUST run on Android, and MUST run as its OWN process — a clean one. Merging
// it into the companion file would silently invalidate one of the two.
