Core runtime for running Gemma 4, Gemma3n, Gemma 3, FastVLM, Qwen3,
Qwen 2.5, DeepSeek R1, Phi-4, FunctionGemma, and SmolLM locally on iOS.
Inference engines are opt-in packages: `flutter_gemma_mediapipe`
(`.task`, MediaPipe GenAI) and `flutter_gemma_litertlm` (`.litertlm`).
Supports multimodal vision + audio, function calling, thinking mode,
text embeddings, and on-device RAG.

  # iOS 15.0 (#441). The 16.0 this replaces was MediaPipe GenAI's, and MediaPipe
  # has lived in flutter_gemma_mediapipe since the 1.0 split — that package still
  # declares 16.0 in its own podspec.
  # Nothing in this package requires 15: its Swift is plain Foundation. Measured at
  # #441 — the highest floor in the transitive native graph was background_downloader's
  # 14.0, and Flutter 3.44's own template floor was 13.0. 15.0 is a deliberate choice:
  # it matches flutter_gemma_builtin_ai, where 15 IS the lowest free floor (Swift
  # Concurrency), and the iOS 26 SDK's RecommendedDeploymentTarget. Not a requirement.

  # No script_phase needed: the upstream LiteRT-LM dlopen path is patched in
  # native/litert_lm/patch_c_api.sh (FLUTTER_GEMMA_GPU_REGISTRY_PATCH) to load
  # accelerator frameworks via their @executable_path-relative .framework path,
  # so the host app's Frameworks/ stays App-Store-clean (no rogue dylibs that
  # would trigger ITMS-90432, see #245).
