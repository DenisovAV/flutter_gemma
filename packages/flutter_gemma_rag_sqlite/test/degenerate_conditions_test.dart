// A condition that "does nothing" still has to do the right nothing.
//
// The translator used to answer a single `null` for two opposite situations:
// "this constrains nothing" and "this can never match". In a `must` bucket
// both can be dropped, which is why the collapse survived. In a `should` (OR)
// they are opposites — dropping a condition that matches everything removes
// the very thing that made the disjunction true — and in `mustNot` they swap
// places again.
//
// Asserted on ROWS from a real vec0 table: the SQL for "ignored" and for
// "always true" is the same empty string, so a string assertion cannot tell
// these cases apart at all.
