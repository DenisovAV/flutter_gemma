// Finding a native library on the HOST, for dev and test runs.
//
// In a real app nothing here is used: the library is in the app bundle and
// dlopen resolves it by its bundled name. On the host there is no bundle, so
// every package that runs native code under `flutter test` has to look for the
// file itself — and three of them had written that search separately
// (litert_bindings.dart, vec0_locator.dart, qdrant_locator.dart). The copies
// had already stopped agreeing, which is how this kind of duplication always
// ends and why the rule now lives in one place.
//
// TWO ORDERING RULES, both bought with incidents rather than chosen:
//
//   1. The hook's download cache comes before any local build artifact. The
//      cache is version-validated by hook/build.dart (`_readMarker` /
//      `_invalidateBundleCacheIfStale`); a local prebuilt is gitignored, made
//      by a hand-run build script, and carries no version marker. They hold the
//      same bytes today. After the next `native-v*` bump a stale local copy
//      would silently shadow the refreshed download, and host tests would run
//      against a different native version than the app ships.
//
//   2. Package-relative paths are walked UP from the working directory rather
//      than assumed. Assuming cost nine red speech tests once: the error named
//      a path and said "not found", so it read as "the library was never built"
//      rather than "I looked in the wrong place", and nobody questioned it.
//
// An explicit environment override stays ahead of both — it is an instruction
// from whoever started the run, and an override that can be overridden is not
// one.
