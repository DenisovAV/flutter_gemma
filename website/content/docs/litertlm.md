`flutter_gemma_litertlm` is the **primary `.litertlm` engine**. (Core registers
no engine by default — you opt in by registering `LiteRtLmEngine()`.) It runs
`.litertlm` models through `dart:ffi` straight onto the **LiteRT-LM C API** — no
JVM, no gRPC — and it is the **primary desktop engine** (macOS, Windows, Linux);
[ONNX Runtime](/docs/onnx) also runs on desktop, and macOS can additionally use
[Built-in AI](/docs/builtin-ai). The native library is fetched at build time via
**Native Assets** (SHA256-verified, from the `native-v0.16.0` GitHub release), so
there's no manual native setup.

The same package also ships **`LiteRtEmbeddingBackend`**, the LiteRT C API
embedding backend — see [Embeddings & RAG](/docs/embeddings-and-rag).

## Platforms

| Platform | Support |
|----------|---------|
| Android | ✅ FFI (GPU via OpenCL, NPU on Qualcomm Snapdragon) |
| iOS | ✅ FFI (GPU via Metal on device; CPU on simulator) |
| macOS / Linux | ✅ FFI (GPU via Metal / Vulkan) |
| Windows | ✅ FFI (CPU + GPU via DirectX 12 + Intel NPU) |
| Web | ⚠️ early preview via `@litert-lm/core` (text-only) |

> **Web is a text-only preview.** It runs through `@litert-lm/core` (WebGPU/WASM)
> supports function calling, but **not** vision, audio, thinking mode or LoRA. Native platforms have the full feature set. On web you also need the JS
> handshake in `web/index.html` (see [Web setup](#web-setup)).

## Setup

Add the package and register `LiteRtLmEngine()` at startup, alongside any other
engines your app uses:

```
dependencies:
  flutter_gemma: latest_version
  flutter_gemma_litertlm: latest_version   # .litertlm inference engine
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter_gemma/flutter_gemma.dart';
import 'package:flutter_gemma_litertlm/flutter_gemma_litertlm.dart';

await FlutterGemma.initialize(
  inferenceEngines: const [LiteRtLmEngine()],
);
```

`LiteRtLmEngine` claims models whose declared `ModelFileType` is `litertlm`; pass
it alongside `MediaPipeEngine` (from `flutter_gemma_mediapipe`) if your app also
uses `.task` models.

## Install a `.litertlm` model

> **Declare the file type.** `installModel` defaults `fileType` to
> `ModelFileType.task`, so a `.litertlm` model **must** set
> `fileType: ModelFileType.litertlm` explicitly — otherwise it is routed to
> MediaPipe instead of this engine.

```dart
await FlutterGemma.installModel(
  modelType: ModelType.gemma4,
  fileType: ModelFileType.litertlm,
).fromNetwork(
  'https://huggingface.co/litert-community/gemma-4-E2B-it-litert-lm/resolve/main/gemma-4-E2B-it.litertlm',
  token: 'hf_...',
).install();

// Create the model once and keep it for the app's lifetime.
final model = await FlutterGemma.getActiveModel(
  maxTokens: 4096,
  preferredBackend: PreferredBackend.gpu,
);

final session = await model.createSession();
await session.addQueryChunk(const Message(text: 'Hello!', isUser: true));
await for (final chunk in session.getResponseAsync()) {
  print(chunk);
}
await session.close();
```

## Backends & acceleration

Pick the accelerator with `preferredBackend:` on `getActiveModel`:

| Backend | Where |
|---------|-------|
| `cpu` | All native platforms |
| `gpu` | Metal (Apple), DirectX 12 / WebGPU (Windows), Vulkan / WebGPU (Linux); required on web |
| `npu` | Android (Qualcomm Snapdragon, `.litertlm`) and Windows (Intel LunarLake / PantherLake) |

GPU is the right default, but it is not uniformly faster: on Android the win is
in **prefill**, and decode can be slower than CPU. One measured pair — Galaxy S26,
the official int8 Qwen2.5-1.5B bundle — has GPU prefill at 2.8× CPU while GPU
decode runs *below* it, 21.8 against 27.8 tok/s
([LiteRT-LM#1748](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/LiteRT-LM/issues/1748#issuecomment-5549035313)).
That is one device and one bundle, not a rule — but if your app is dominated by
long replies rather than long prompts, measure both before assuming.

The GPU runs the model at half precision unless you ask otherwise, and the
published Gemma 4 files ask for it. From about 2,000 prompt tokens, Gemma 4 then
copies digits wrongly. `activationDataType: ActivationDataType.float32` on
`getActiveModel` fixes it at the cost of a slower prefill; left unset, the model
file decides. It applies to the text decoder of `.litertlm` models on Android,
iOS and desktop — not on web, and not to the vision or audio encoders, which
keep what the model file asks for. `float32` also needs more GPU memory, and a
GPU engine that cannot be created falls back to CPU silently, so read
`model.activeBackend` afterwards. See [Troubleshooting → Wrong numbers on
GPU](/docs/troubleshooting#wrong-numbers-on-gpu).

Windows NPU ships the Intel dispatch stack — `LiteRtDispatch.dll` + the OpenVino
runtime + TBB — inside the Windows native archive. Android bundles the Qualcomm
QNN dispatch stack. No extra downloads for either NPU path.

<Warning>
**NPU is a Gemma 4 story today.** Our NPU verification runs Gemma 4 bundles, and
those work on both vendors. The **Gemma 3** family does not, and it fails
silently — the model answers from the first prefill chunk alone, fluently,
with no error and nothing in the log:

- **Qualcomm.** A compiled bundle carries a prefill mask of
  `2 B × num_attention_heads × prefill × (cache_length + prefill)`. Above ~1 MiB
  every chunk after the first is dropped. For the 4-head Gemma 3 bundles that
  makes **896** the largest working `cache_length` at prefill 128 — and *every*
  published `qualcomm.*` Gemma 3 bundle is built above the line (270M at cache
  4096 is 4.125 MiB, 1B ekv1280 is 1.375 MiB). A 16-head model such as Qwen3-0.6B
  has no working value at prefill 128 at all.
- **Intel.** The second chunk is lost regardless of mask size — a different
  defect on the OpenVINO path, which Gemma 4 bundles do not hit.

Both are tracked upstream in
[LiteRT-LM#3508](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/LiteRT-LM/issues/3508).
Because the safe context is a property of the compiled bundle, `maxTokens` is
**not** clamped up to 1024 on the NPU attempt (it is on CPU and GPU — see below),
so pass the `cache_length` the bundle was compiled for. Note that requesting
`PreferredBackend.npu` does not guarantee the NPU runs: if it fails to
initialize, the engine falls back to GPU and then CPU, and the floor applies
again to those attempts — so a value chosen for an NPU bundle is raised to 1024
on the fallback rather than crashing it.
</Warning>

## `maxTokens` is the CONTEXT window, not the reply length

`maxTokens` (on `getActiveModel` / `createModel`) sizes the whole **context
window** — system prompt + history + message **plus** the generated output (the
KV-cache budget), not the response length. `.litertlm` models bake a fixed
`kv_cache_max_len` of 1024, so this engine **clamps `maxTokens` up to 1024** (with
a log warning) to avoid a native KV-cache crash — on every backend attempt except
the NPU one, where the bundle's own compiled `cache_length` governs instead (see
the NPU warning above).

To cap **generation length**, use `maxOutputTokens` on the session:

```dart
final model = await FlutterGemma.getActiveModel(maxTokens: 4096); // context
final session = await model.createSession(maxOutputTokens: 100);  // reply cap
```

## Web setup

`.litertlm` web inference runs via `@litert-lm/core`. The ESM doesn't assign
window globals, so add this handshake to your `web/index.html` `<head>` — Dart
awaits `window.litertLmReady` (which resolves to the `Engine` constructor):

```
<script type="module">
window.litertLmReady = (async () => {
  const m = await import('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@litert-lm/core@0.17.0/+esm');
  window.Engine = m.Engine;
  return m.Engine;
})();
</script>
```

Native platforms need no web setup.
