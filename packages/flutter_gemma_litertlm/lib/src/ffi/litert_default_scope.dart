// Opening libLiteRtLm on Android so its exports land in the process-wide
// default symbol search scope — and proving that they did.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS (#447)
//
// On Android, the FIRST dlopen of a library decides whether its exports are
// reachable through `dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT)`, and nothing afterwards can change
// that decision:
//
//   * Dart's `DynamicLibrary.open` passes RTLD_LAZY only. POSIX leaves the
//     resulting scope UNSPECIFIED when neither flag is given — bionic and
//     glibc choose RTLD_LOCAL, Apple chooses RTLD_GLOBAL — so on Android the
//     soinfo is filed WITHOUT the RTLD_GLOBAL flag
//   * bionic's `dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT)` walks only soinfos carrying that flag
//   * re-opening the same file with RTLD_GLOBAL returns the EXISTING soinfo
//     with its refcount bumped and its flags untouched — bionic does not
//     promote (glibc does, which is why Linux never showed this)
//
// So an app that reaches embeddings or speech before generating leaves
// stream_proxy.c's ABI probe blind: `litert_lm_stream_chunk_get_text` resolves
// to NULL, that is read as "pre-v0.15 library", and the 4-arg callback shape
// is registered against a 2-arg caller. Arguments 3 and 4 are then whatever
// x2/x3 happen to hold, and `strdup` runs on the result.
//
// Measured on an API 36 arm64 emulator (`loader_order_447_test.dart` and
// `loader_order_fixed_447_test.dart` in the example's integration tests):
//
//   plain open first                      -> not visible
//   plain open, then RTLD_GLOBAL open     -> STILL not visible, handle non-NULL
//   RTLD_GLOBAL open, then plain open     -> visible
//
// The middle row is why this file verifies rather than trusts. The last row is
// why preventing the bad order is sufficient: a later RTLD_LOCAL open does not
// demote an already-global soinfo.
//
// Both entry points go through this file, and both functions here do the raw
// `DynamicLibrary.open` themselves. That is deliberate: the original bug was a
// bare `DynamicLibrary.open` that reached production because the preload step
// is easy to forget, so there is no longer a version of this operation that
// omits it.
//
// ANDROID ONLY, deliberately. On glibc a later RTLD_GLOBAL dlopen promotes the
// object, so Linux repairs itself as soon as the LLM path runs. Windows has no
// process-wide symbol namespace at all — PE imports bind to (module, symbol)
// pairs and `GetProcAddress` requires an HMODULE, so there is no
// `dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT)` to be blind: stream_proxy_resolve looks the module up
// by name with GetModuleHandleA. And on Apple
// dlopen defaults to RTLD_GLOBAL, so `dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT)` searches every
// loaded image.
//
// Note that on Android LiteRT and LiteRT-LM are ONE physical shared object:
// `litert_bindings.dart`'s Android branch opens `libLiteRtLm.so` for the LiteRT
// C API, where its Linux/Windows branches open a separate `libLiteRt.so` /
// `LiteRt.dll`. That is why an embeddings binding has to care about a hazard
// named after the LM library.
