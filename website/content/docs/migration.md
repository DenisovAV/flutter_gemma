## flutter_gemma → flutter_edge_ai (1.11.3)

The project is now **Flutter Edge AI**. Every package moved to a new name; the
code, the platforms and the on-device data are the same.

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| `flutter_gemma` | `flutter_edge_ai` 1.11.3 |
| `flutter_gemma_litertlm` | `flutter_edge_ai_litertlm` 1.8.5 |
| `flutter_gemma_mediapipe` | `flutter_edge_ai_mediapipe` 1.0.8 |
| `flutter_gemma_embeddings` | `flutter_edge_ai_embeddings` 2.2.1 |
| `flutter_gemma_rag_sqlite` | `flutter_edge_ai_sqlite` 1.4.0 |
| `flutter_gemma_rag_qdrant` | `flutter_edge_ai_qdrant` 1.3.2 |
| `flutter_gemma_speech` | `flutter_edge_ai_speech` 0.5.2 |
| `flutter_gemma_agent` | `flutter_edge_ai_agent` 0.2.6 |
| `flutter_gemma_builtin_ai` | `flutter_edge_ai_builtin_ai` 0.3.0 |
| `flutter_gemma_onnx` | `flutter_edge_ai_onnx` 0.5.1 |
| `flutter_gemma_diagnostics` | `flutter_edge_ai_diagnostics` 0.1.0 |
| `genkit_flutter_gemma` | `genkit_flutter_edge_ai` 0.6.2 |

The old `flutter_gemma*` packages stay on pub.dev as they are, so an app that
has not moved yet keeps working.

To move:

1. Replace each `flutter_gemma*` dependency in `pubspec.yaml` with its new name
   and the version from the table.
2. Replace `package:flutter_gemma` with `package:flutter_edge_ai` in your
   imports — the same for every other package in the table. A project-wide
   search and replace does it.
3. Run `dart fix --apply`. It renames `FlutterGemma`, `FlutterGemmaPlugin`,
   `FlutterGemmaDesktop`, `GemmaLogLevel`, `FlutterGemmaDiagnostics` and the
   genkit names to their new spellings. Until you run it they still compile as
   deprecated aliases, up to `flutter_edge_ai` 2.0.0.

If you installed the agent skills, run `dart run skills@ get --all` again
and delete the old `flutter-gemma-*` skill directories: they still teach the
old names.

What does not change:

- Installed models, the model directory and the Web cache stay where they are,
  so nothing downloads again.
- Existing Qdrant and SQLite vector stores open as before.
- The Android package `dev.flutterberlin.*`, the platform channels and the
  macOS `post_install` snippet in your Podfile are unchanged.

Genkit: model and embedder ids are now `flutter-edge-ai/<name>`, and the
context-window middleware is registered as `flutter-edge-ai-context-window`.
Code that uses `flutterEdgeAi.model(...)` and `trimContext()` picks this up; a
hard-coded `'flutter-gemma/<name>'` string has to change. The old Dart names are
deprecated aliases here too, until `genkit_flutter_edge_ai` 0.7.0.

Move every package at once: an app that keeps a `flutter_gemma_X` next to
`flutter_edge_ai_X` gets the same native libraries and Android classes twice,
and the build fails. An old satellite you did not move (say
`flutter_gemma_speech`) pulls the old engine back in the same way.

`flutter_edge_ai_sqlite` needs Flutter 3.47. An app on Flutter 3.44 that uses
the SQLite store upgrades Flutter first.

## flutter_gemma 0.x → 1.0

1.0 split the monolithic `flutter_gemma` plugin into a small **core** package
plus **opt-in** packages, so your app only ships the native weight it actually
uses. This is the **only breaking change**: you add the packages you need and one
`initialize(...)` call. **Every model / session / chat / embedding / RAG API is
unchanged** — your existing inference code keeps working as-is.

## TL;DR

1. Add the opt-in packages for the formats/features you use (see table below).
2. Call `await FlutterEdgeAi.initialize(inferenceEngines: [...], ...)` once in `main()`, passing the engines/backends from the packages you added.
3. Everything else stays the same.

## 1. pubspec.yaml

**Before (0.16.x):**

```
dependencies:
  flutter_gemma: ^0.16.3
```

**After (1.0):**

```
dependencies:
  flutter_edge_ai: ^1.11.3                 # core — always required
  flutter_edge_ai_litertlm: ^1.8.5        # add if you run .litertlm models (also provides LiteRtEmbeddingBackend)
  flutter_edge_ai_mediapipe: ^1.0.8       # add if you run .task / .bin models
  flutter_edge_ai_embeddings: ^2.2.1      # add if you compute embeddings (needs a backend, see above)
  flutter_edge_ai_qdrant: ^1.3.2      # add for native on-device RAG (qdrant)
  flutter_edge_ai_sqlite: ^1.4.0      # add for on-device RAG (sqlite-vec; all platforms incl. web) — needs Flutter 3.47
```

Pick by what you actually used in 0.16.x:

| In 0.16.x you used… | Add in 1.0 |
|---|---|
| `.litertlm` models (Gemma 4, Qwen3, FastVLM, any desktop) | `flutter_edge_ai_litertlm` |
| `.task` / `.bin` models (Gemma3n, Gemma 3, DeepSeek, Qwen 2.5, Phi-4, …) | `flutter_edge_ai_mediapipe` |
| `generateEmbedding()` / `installEmbedder()` | `flutter_edge_ai_embeddings` + `flutter_edge_ai_litertlm` (`LiteRtEmbeddingBackend`) |
| RAG (`addDocument` / `searchSimilar`), fastest on native | `flutter_edge_ai_qdrant` |
| RAG on web (or a portable store on any platform) | `flutter_edge_ai_sqlite` |

<Info>
Not sure which format your models are? Desktop is always `.litertlm`
(`flutter_edge_ai_litertlm`). On mobile/web check the file extension you install.
You can add **both** engine packages and let the registry route each model by its
file type.
</Info>

> **New opt-in packages since 1.2** (not migration targets from the 0.16.x
> monolith — they add new capabilities): `flutter_edge_ai_agent` (on-device agent
> skills — SKILL.md + tool-calling loop), `flutter_edge_ai_builtin_ai` (OS
> system models — Gemini Nano on Android and Web, Apple Foundation Models on
> iOS/macOS, Windows AI Foundry on Windows),
> and `flutter_edge_ai_onnx` (ONNX Runtime — ORT-GenAI text generation +
> plain-ORT embeddings via `dart:ffi` on native, + Web via Transformers.js /
> onnxruntime-web). Add any of them only if you want that feature. See
> [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started).

## Breaking: embeddings 2.0.0 — `LiteRtEmbeddingBackend` moved

<Warning>
`flutter_gemma_embeddings` **2.0.0** is a breaking change, independent of the
0.16.x → 1.0 migration above. As of `flutter_gemma_litertlm` **1.5.0**,
`flutter_edge_ai_embeddings` no longer ships a concrete embedding backend — it's
now a runtime-agnostic pipeline (tokenizer, pooling, isolate worker) that any
engine package can implement. `LiteRtEmbeddingBackend` moved to
`flutter_edge_ai_litertlm`.
</Warning>

If your app registers `LiteRtEmbeddingBackend()`, fix the import and bump both
dependencies:

```dart
// Before (< 2.0.0):
import 'package:flutter_gemma_embeddings/flutter_gemma_embeddings.dart';

// After (>= 2.0.0):
import 'package:flutter_edge_ai_litertlm/flutter_edge_ai_litertlm.dart';
```

```
dependencies:
  flutter_edge_ai_embeddings: ^2.2.1   # runtime-agnostic pipeline (still required)
  flutter_edge_ai_litertlm: ^1.8.5     # now provides LiteRtEmbeddingBackend
```

`LiteRtEmbeddingBackend()` itself is unchanged — only where the class is
imported from. Since litertlm 1.8.0 it also needs a tokenizer registered
beside it: add `flutter_edge_ai_embeddings` to your pubspec and pass
`embeddingTokenizers: [GemmaEmbeddingTokenizers()]`, or the first embedding
throws a `StateError` naming that step. You still depend on
`flutter_edge_ai_embeddings` (it owns the tokenizer/pooling/worker); you just no
longer import a backend class from it. If you'd rather run embeddings over an
ONNX/ORT model instead, `flutter_edge_ai_onnx`'s `OnnxEmbeddingBackend` is a
drop-in alternative — see [Packages](/docs/packages#onnx-runtime-engine).

## Breaking: flutter_gemma_builtin_ai 0.3.0 — the native layer moved to `flutter_local_ai`

<Warning>
`flutter_gemma_builtin_ai` **0.3.0** is no longer a Flutter plugin. It ships no
Kotlin/Swift/C++ and no pigeon; every OS backend now comes from
[`flutter_local_ai`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_ai), which it depends
on. **No Dart code changes** — `BuiltInAi`, `BuiltInAiEngine`,
`BuiltInAiModels`, `BuiltInAiAvailability`, `BuiltInAiUnavailableException` and
`BuiltInAiHuggingFaceResolver` keep their names and signatures — but three
build-level things move.
</Warning>

1. **`pub get` regenerates the plugin registrants and `Podfile.lock`**: this
   package leaves them, `flutter_local_ai` enters. CI that runs a frozen
   `pod install --deployment` fails until you re-commit the lockfile.
2. **The macOS deployment floor rises from 10.15 to 12.0.** A macOS 11 target
   fails resolution with a message naming the `flutter_local_ai` pod, not the
   package you added. iOS is unaffected — `flutter_local_ai` builds from 13.0 and
   core `flutter_edge_ai` still requires 15.0.
3. **`package:flutter_gemma_builtin_ai/pigeon.g.dart` is gone** with the channel
   it wrapped. It was generated plumbing that the documented API never used.

In exchange, **Windows joins the supported platforms** (AI Foundry / Phi Silica),
and `BuiltInAiModels` gains `windowsAiFoundry`, `chromePromptApi`, `all` and
`forCurrentPlatform`. Requesting vision on a backend that has none now throws at
model creation instead of dropping images mid-conversation. See [Built-in
AI](/docs/builtin-ai).

## Breaking: rag_sqlite 1.1.0 — the index does not carry over

<Warning>
`flutter_gemma_rag_sqlite` **1.1.0** replaced the Dart brute-force/HNSW store
with in-SQLite `vec0` KNN, and with it the table the index lives in:
`documents` became `vec_documents`. **An index written by 1.0.x is not read by
1.1.0+.** This shipped as a minor version with no note — if you upgraded and
your RAG answers went vague, this is why.
</Warning>

Nothing errors. `initialize()` succeeds, `getStats()` reports **0 documents**,
`searchSimilar()` returns **no hits**, and your rows are still sitting in the
old `documents` table, unread. The model then answers without the context it
used to have, which reads as the model getting worse rather than as a
migration you missed.

**Your data is recoverable.** Unlike the qdrant break below, nothing is lost:
1.0.x stored `id`, `content`, the `embedding` as a `Float32` BLOB and
`metadata` in a plain table, all still readable. Move it once at startup — no
re-embedding, no model needed:

```dart
import 'dart:typed_data';
import 'package:sqlite3/sqlite3.dart';   // add sqlite3 to your own pubspec

final store = SqliteVectorStore();
await store.initialize(path);

final db = sqlite3.open(path);
final hasLegacy = db
    .select("SELECT name FROM sqlite_master "
            "WHERE type='table' AND name='documents'")
    .isNotEmpty;

if (hasLegacy) {
  for (final row
      in db.select('SELECT id, content, embedding, metadata FROM documents')) {
    // 1.0.x wrote each element with setFloat32(..., Endian.little); read it
    // back the same way. ByteData.sublistView needs no 4-byte alignment,
    // which a raw asFloat32List view of the BLOB would.
    final bytes = ByteData.sublistView(row['embedding'] as Uint8List);
    await store.addDocument(
      id: row['id'] as String,
      content: row['content'] as String,
      embedding: List<double>.generate(
        bytes.lengthInBytes ~/ 4,
        (i) => bytes.getFloat32(i * 4, Endian.little),
      ),
      metadata: row['metadata'] as String?,
    );
  }
  db.execute('DROP TABLE documents');   // only after the loop succeeds
}
db.close();
```

Guard it with your own "already migrated" flag if you prefer, but the
`sqlite_master` check is enough: dropping the table is what makes the block a
no-op on every later launch.

There is no built-in migration call — this is a one-time fix for an upgrade
that has already happened, not an ongoing API.

## Breaking: rag_qdrant 1.3.0 — the on-disk store is not readable

<Warning>
`flutter_gemma_rag_qdrant` **1.3.0** moves onto the official `qdrant_edge`
UniFFI SDK, and **an index written by 1.2 or earlier cannot be read**. This is a
data change, not an API change: your `addDocument` / `searchSimilar` calls are
unchanged, but the documents already on the device are not.
</Warning>

An upgraded app finds no documents where its corpus used to be. 1.3.0 refuses
loudly rather than starting empty — `initialize()` throws a
`QdrantLegacyStoreException` naming the old store — so this shows up the first
time the store opens, not as silently unanswered questions later.

Remove the old store's files once, then re-index. 1.3.0 will not do it for you:
it never deletes data it cannot read, and the three entries a 1.x shard owns
(`edge_config.json`, `wal/`, `segments/`) may sit beside files of your own.

```dart
import 'package:flutter_edge_ai_qdrant/flutter_edge_ai_qdrant.dart';

final store = QdrantVectorStore();
try {
  await store.initialize(path);
} on QdrantLegacyStoreException catch (e) {
  // e.message names the three entries a 1.x shard owns. Remove them with the
  // file APIs you already use for `path`, then initialize() again.
  rethrow;
}
// ...then re-add your documents, and flush() — on qdrant, points live in the
// shard's in-RAM segment until then, so a background kill loses the re-index.
```

<Warning>
Catch `QdrantLegacyStoreException`, not the base `VectorStoreException`.
`initialize()` also throws the base type when a 2.0 shard is present but will
not open right now — a WAL held by another store, a permission problem — and
treating that as "the old format is here" is how a recovery step can act on a
store that is perfectly fine.
</Warning>

`clear()` no longer deletes anything: it empties the shard in place, and it
refuses when a 1.x layout is present rather than removing files it cannot
read.

If your app has no re-indexing path of its own, do the re-index behind the same
progress UI you use for the first run — from the user's side this is a rebuild
of the index, not a migration they can be asked to wait through silently.

## 2. main.dart — the one new call

**Before (0.16.x):** engines were bundled into core; `initialize()` was optional.

```dart
void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  // (initialize was optional — only for HF token / retries)
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

**After (1.0):** register the packages you added.

```dart
import 'package:flutter_edge_ai/flutter_edge_ai.dart';
import 'package:flutter_edge_ai_embeddings/flutter_edge_ai_embeddings.dart';
import 'package:flutter_edge_ai_litertlm/flutter_edge_ai_litertlm.dart';
import 'package:flutter_edge_ai_mediapipe/flutter_edge_ai_mediapipe.dart';
import 'package:flutter_edge_ai_qdrant/flutter_edge_ai_qdrant.dart';

void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  await FlutterEdgeAi.initialize(
    inferenceEngines: const [LiteRtLmEngine(), MediaPipeEngine()],
    embeddingBackends: const [LiteRtEmbeddingBackend()], // flutter_edge_ai_litertlm
    embeddingTokenizers: const [GemmaEmbeddingTokenizers()], // flutter_edge_ai_embeddings
    vectorStore: QdrantVectorStore(),          // or WebSqliteVectorStore() on web
    // '' when the define is absent — an empty token still sends a bare
    // `Authorization: Bearer` header, so pass null instead.
    huggingFaceToken: const String.fromEnvironment('HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN').isNotEmpty
        ? const String.fromEnvironment('HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN')
        : null,
  );

  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

Only list what you ship. If you don't do embeddings, omit `embeddingBackends`; if
you don't do RAG, omit `vectorStore`.

## 3. Everything else is unchanged

Model, session and chat calls keep the exact same API — no edits needed. Your
0.16.x RAG calls on `FlutterEdgeAiPlugin.instance` (`initializeVectorStore`, …)
still compile; since 1.5 the canonical entry is the `FlutterEdgeAi.rag`
namespace shown below, and `flush()` arrived in 1.8.1:

```dart
// install + run a model
await FlutterEdgeAi.installModel(
    modelType: ModelType.gemma4, fileType: ModelFileType.litertlm)
    .fromNetwork(url, token: token).install();
final model = await FlutterEdgeAi.getActiveModel(maxTokens: 2048);
final chat  = await model.createChat();
await chat.addQueryChunk(Message.text(text: 'Hello', isUser: true));
await for (final r in chat.generateChatResponseAsync()) { /* r is a ModelResponse */ }

// embeddings + RAG
await FlutterEdgeAi.installEmbedder()
    .modelFromNetwork(modelUrl, token: token)
    .tokenizerFromNetwork(tokenizerUrl, token: token)
    .install();
final dir = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory(); // native; on web pass a bare name
await FlutterEdgeAi.rag.initialize('${dir.path}/rag_store');
await FlutterEdgeAi.rag.addDocument(/* ... */);
await FlutterEdgeAi.rag.flush();   // qdrant: required, or the index dies with the process
final hits = await FlutterEdgeAi.rag.searchSimilar(query: query, topK: 5);
```

## What you'll see if you forget step 2

- Calling `getActiveModel()` with no matching `inferenceEngines` registered throws a `StateError` naming the model's `ModelFileType` and the engines that are registered — add the engine package for that file type.
- `createEmbeddingModel()` / auto-embedding RAG with no `embeddingBackends` throws a clear "add `flutter_edge_ai_litertlm`" error.
- RAG calls with no `vectorStore` throw "add a RAG package" (the default store is an unconfigured sentinel).

## Platform setup

Native setup moved to the package that owns it:

- **MediaPipe Gradle / Pod deps + the `@mediapipe/tasks-genai` web CDN** are now in `flutter_edge_ai_mediapipe` (bundled automatically on Android/iOS; add the CDN `<script>` for web).
- **The `.litertlm` native library + the `@litert-lm/core` web CDN** are in `flutter_edge_ai_litertlm`.
- **The sqlite-vec web loader** (`sqlite3.wasm` with `sqlite-vec` statically linked) is in `flutter_edge_ai_sqlite`.

The iOS/Android entitlements and manifest entries still apply when you ship an
inference engine. See the full [Installation guide](/docs/installation).

## Troubleshooting

**`dlopen` "library not found" after removing a package:** if you had both
`flutter_edge_ai_litertlm` and `flutter_edge_ai_embeddings` and removed one, run
`flutter clean` and delete `~/Library/Caches/flutter_gemma/native` (Linux:
`~/.cache/flutter_gemma/native`, Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\flutter_gemma\native`),
then `flutter pub get`.
`flutter_edge_ai_litertlm` owns the native LiteRT library;
`flutter_edge_ai_embeddings` (and `flutter_edge_ai_speech`) consume it
transitively — they have no Native-Assets hook of their own.
