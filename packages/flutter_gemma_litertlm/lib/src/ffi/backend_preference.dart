/// Intel's (`LiteRtDispatch.dll` + OpenVino + TBB), each in its own native
/// tarball. Nothing ships for macOS, Linux or iOS.
///
/// This gate exists because `backend: "npu"` is a string the native runtime
/// accepts WITHOUT complaint on a host that cannot honour it. Since
/// [initializeFfiRuntime] reports the first candidate whose init did not throw,
/// a Mac asking for NPU got a model claiming `activeBackend == npu` —
/// measured, on macOS, with a Gemma 4 E2B `.litertlm`.
/// `InferenceModel.activeBackend` promises to "reflect any fallback the plugin
/// performed internally", so that was a false report: a benchmark asking for
/// NPU attributed its CPU or GPU numbers to an NPU the machine does not have.
///
/// Windows is still gated per OS, and that is known to be too coarse.
/// Measured 2026-09-27 on a Windows Server VM with no NPU (Xeon + T4): a
/// generic Gemma 4 E2B requested on npu passed `engine_create`, answered
/// correctly and reported `npu` — faster than explicit cpu, so it ran
/// somewhere else. Android got a hardware probe ([_androidHasFastRpc]);
/// Windows has none yet because its positive arm can only be verified on
/// Intel NPU silicon, and a probe guessed without that could switch off the
/// NPU on the machines that have one.

/// costs a 55.1 MiB zip extraction out of the APK into `codeCacheDir` — measured
/// on the native-v0.17.1 bundle, of which 44 MiB is the four per-SoC Skels — and
/// that extraction runs on the platform thread inside a `MethodChannel` handler,
/// so it stalls input dispatch and the Choreographer. `codeCacheDir` is
/// cache-class storage, so "Clear cache" and every app
/// upgrade make it happen again.
///
/// `libcdsprpc.so` is the precondition for the chain: the per-SoC `QnnHtp*Stub`
/// libraries carry it as a `DT_NEEDED`, and the core plugin's manifest declares
/// it `required="false"` so it resolves in the app's namespace where it exists.
/// So one `dlopen` answers whether there is a Hexagon DSP at all, before the
/// gate lets anything reach the channel that does the extracting. Necessary,
/// not sufficient: a Snapdragon whose Hexagon version has no Skel in the bundle
