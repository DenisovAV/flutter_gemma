/// Upstream LiteRT-LM #2080 retest — are per-session sampler params still
/// baked at the engine's FIRST generation on v0.16.0?
///
/// Reproduces the signature posted upstream on 2026-07-28 (v0.14.0, macOS
/// arm64, Gemma 4 E2B):
///
///   G = greedy   (topK=1,  temp=0.8, seed=1) on engine A, first generation
///   X = stochastic (topK=64, temp=1.5, seed=7) on the SAME engine A
///   Y = stochastic again on the SAME engine A
///   Z = stochastic on a FRESH engine B          <- control
///   G2= greedy    (same params as G) on a FRESH engine C   <- anchor
///
///   bug present : X == Y == G  and  Z != G   (engine locked to what the first
///                                             generation baked)
///   bug fixed   : X != G                     (later sessions honour params)
///
/// Two controls, because each rules out a different way of passing wrongly.
/// Z != G proves the stochastic params *can* produce different text, so an
/// X == G is baking rather than a prompt too peaked to diverge. G2 == G proves
/// the greedy params took effect at all — without it, a build that ignores
/// sampler params *entirely* makes G stochastic, X/Y/Z differ from it by
/// chance, and the harness reports "fixed" on a build that honours nothing.
///
/// Run: cd example && flutter test integration_test/sampler_baking_2080_test.dart -d macos
