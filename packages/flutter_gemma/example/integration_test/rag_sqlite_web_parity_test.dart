/// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
///
/// `flutter_gemma_rag_sqlite`'s README says both arms "speak the same `vec0` SQL
/// dialect, so KNN and `Filter` behave identically across all six platforms".
/// Until this file that was an assertion nobody checked: every one of the
/// package's VM tests ran on the VM, and the web arm had none. Metadata
/// ENCODING is shared (`FilterToVec0.declaredColumnValues`); what is separate,
/// and what drifted, is SQL emission, value binding and row mapping.
///
/// It is not a hypothetical drift. 1.2.0 shipped a fix for "the web arm
/// rejecting integer metadata the native arm accepts", and 1.3.0 fixed three
/// more that the web arm had been shipping since 1.2.0 — every one of them
/// found by reading, because nothing ran the web arm.
///
/// The `Filter` -> SQL codec IS shared (`filter_to_vec0.dart`, imported by both
/// arms), so this suite deliberately does NOT assert generated SQL — that would
/// be a restatement of one implementation. It asserts ROWS, over the corpus in
/// `parity_cases.dart`, which is the same table the native suite runs. A case
/// added there is automatically checked on both arms; a case that passes here
/// and fails natively (or the reverse) is exactly the drift this exists for.
///
/// The fixture lives in the package's `lib/src/testing/` and is `.pubignore`d,
/// because the two suites are in different packages: `test/` has no `package:`
/// URI, and a `../../..` path out of the example is not something to build a
/// shared contract on. (An earlier note here blamed dart2js for refusing such
/// an import. That was wrong — it compiles — so whatever broke the first
/// attempt was something else and stays undiagnosed.)
