///
///   flutter_gemma #348 (Pixel 4a, Android 13, GPU): openChat per turn +
///     generateChatResponseAsync streaming, maxTokens 4096, temp 0.2, topK 20,
///     tokenBuffer 256 -> Native Heap ratcheted 150-300 MB per inference.
///   flutter_gemma #402 (Vivo iQOO, Android 12, GPU): createChat per turn +
///     streaming, maxTokens 2048 -> ~65 MB per inference, OOM after ~18.
///
/// An earlier version of this test used the raw session API, non-streaming
/// getResponse(), and maxTokens 1024 — a different code path with a 4x smaller
/// KV cache. It showed no growth, which said nothing about the reported bug.
///
