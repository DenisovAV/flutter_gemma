/// `activationDataType` regression: Gemma 4 copying figures out of a long
/// prompt on the GPU.
///
/// At the default activation type (FLOAT16 on GPU, and what the published
/// Gemma 4 `.litertlm` files ask for) GPUs scramble digits once the prompt is
/// long, the same way on every run: asked when a delivery arrived
/// (`2026/06/23`), E2B answers `2026/12/7` on an M3 Max and `20206/12/7` on an
/// iPhone 11; E4B answers `20226/12/17` on an M3 Max and a Snapdragon 8 Elite.
/// `ActivationDataType.float32` fixes it (LiteRT-LM#2814 on Metal, #3012 on
/// Adreno).
///
/// The prompt is a made-up delivery log, identical on every run: 64 lines,
/// about 3,100 tokens, each line with two dates and two amounts. Three
/// questions make the model copy some of them back. On an Apple M3 Max, E2B
/// and E4B at the default precision copied every figure right with logs of up
/// to 32 lines (~1,600 tokens) and wrong from 48 lines (~2,300). A Snapdragon 8
/// Elite got this 64-line log wrong with E4B, and other prompts wrong from
/// ~2,100 tokens.
///
/// An answer fails on either count:
/// - SCRAMBLED — it holds a figure that is nowhere in the log. That is the bug.
/// - NO FIGURE — it holds none of the figures the question asked for. A
///   refusal, an "it is not in the log" or a paraphrase copies nothing, and
///   counting only scrambled figures would pass it as clean.
///
/// A real figure from the wrong line is the model misreading (E2B does it now
/// and then at any precision), so it is printed, not counted.
///
/// On native targets both tests check that the GPU started, since the engine
/// falls back to CPU quietly and the CPU does not show the bug.
/// - float32 must scramble nothing and must answer with figures: that test
///   asserts both.
/// - The default's answers are printed, and only checked for being there,
///   since a GPU without the bug copies right either way. Its lines start with
///   `[default]`.
///
/// Every answer is printed with its time to first token, which is prefill and
/// therefore the part float32 slows down; the float32 test prints its mean
/// against the default run's. A ratio near 1.00× means the setting never
/// reached the engine — the run proves nothing then, however clean it looks.
/// It is printed rather than asserted because on an M3 Max the difference is
/// small enough to be flaky; on a device where the bug reproduces, pass
/// `--dart-define=MIN_PREFILL_RATIO=1.5` to make it an assertion.
///
/// On web only the default test runs. The web engine does not read
/// `activationDataType` (`@litert-lm/core` 0.17 has no such setting), runs the
/// `-web.litertlm` files on its own GPU executor, and reports neither a backend
/// nor session metrics, so no time to first token is printed there.
///
/// Gemma 4 E2B by default; pass `--dart-define=GEMMA4=E4B` for E4B (native
/// only: the E4B web file is over 2 GB). **Android wants E4B**: the Snapdragon
/// 8 Elite run that showed the bug was E4B, and E2B has not been seen to
/// scramble anything on that phone, so the default E2B run there says little
/// either way.
///
/// Prerequisites (otherwise the model is downloaded: E2B 2.59 GB, E4B 3.66 GB,
/// E2B web 2.01 GB):
///   macOS:   gemma-4-E2B-it.litertlm in ~/Library/Containers/.../Documents/
///   Android: adb push gemma-4-E4B-it.litertlm /data/local/tmp/flutter_gemma_test/
///   iOS, web: downloaded via FlutterGemma.installModel()
///
/// Run, native:
///   flutter test integration_test/activation_data_type_test.dart -d <device>
///   Android: add --dart-define=GEMMA4=E4B
///
/// Run, web — from `example/`, with `chromedriver --port=4444` up:
///   flutter drive \
///     --driver=test_driver/integration_test.dart \
///     --target=integration_test/activation_data_type_test.dart \
///     -d web-server
///   `-d chrome` hangs there on Flutter 3.47.2, and `flutter run` reports no
///   pass or fail at all. Note that `integrationDriver` gives up after 20
///   minutes while these tests allow 30, so a first run that downloads the
///   2 GB web model can hit that limit — run it once to fill the cache, then
///   again for a result. On Chrome 153 with WebGPU on an M3 Max, nothing was
///   scrambled.
