Use when writing or debugging that code, when a native symbol fails to resolve at dlopen/LoadLibrary time, or when a struct layout differs between MSVC and GCC/Clang.

# C/C++ for flutter_gemma

You work on a small but load-bearing native surface. It is small enough to
enumerate, so enumerate it before assuming anything.

## The entire C/C++ surface (verify with the command, do not trust this list)

```bash
find packages -type f \( -name '*.c' -o -name '*.cc' -o -name '*.cpp' \
  -o -name '*.h' -o -name '*.hpp' \) | grep -v /example/ | grep -v /build/ | sort
```

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `packages/flutter_gemma_litertlm/native/litert_lm/stream_proxy.c` | The one piece of C we author and ship. Adapts LiteRT-LM's streaming callback to the shape our Dart `NativeCallable` expects, choosing the shape at **runtime**. |
| `packages/flutter_gemma_litertlm/native/litert_lm/include/engine.h` | The LiteRT-LM C API header our `litert_lm_bindings.dart` is generated from. |
| `packages/flutter_gemma_rag_qdrant/native/qdrant_edge/include/qdrant_edge.h` | C header over a Rust `cdylib`. |
| `packages/flutter_gemma_rag_sqlite/native/sqlite_vec/src/sqlite-vec.{c,h}` | Vendored sqlite-vec amalgamation, built into the `vec0` loadable extension. |
| `packages/flutter_gemma_rag_sqlite/tool/sqlite_vec_patches/{getentropy.c,os_web.c}` | Patches so the amalgamation builds for wasm. |
| `packages/flutter_gemma/{linux/flutter_gemma_plugin.cc,windows/flutter_gemma_plugin.cpp}` + their `include/flutter_gemma/*.h` | The desktop Flutter plugin registration shims. Thin — inference is Dart FFI, not C++. |

There is **no** Objective-C++ in the tree, no MediaPipe C++ layer, no
SentencePiece, no protobuf. Desktop inference does not go through JNI or gRPC.
If a task description mentions any of those, it predates 0.14.0 — say so instead
of hunting for the file.

## Hazards that have actually bitten this project

**`_GNU_SOURCE` must precede every include on glibc.** `RTLD_DEFAULT` is a GNU
extension that `<dlfcn.h>` only exposes under it. Apple's libc declares it
unconditionally, so a macOS build compiles happily and Linux fails with
"RTLD_DEFAULT undeclared". `stream_proxy.c` opens with exactly this guard —
preserve it, and put any new include after it.

**Runtime ABI probing, not compile-time.** LiteRT-LM v0.15.0 changed
`LiteRtLmStreamCallback` from four arguments to two (an opaque chunk object) with
no compat overload and no version symbol. C linkage means a stale call shape
still links and you get register garbage — ACCESS_VIOLATION on Windows,
malformed UTF-8 on macOS, at the first token. `stream_proxy.c` therefore resolves
`litert_lm_stream_chunk_get_text` via `dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT, …)` /
`GetProcAddress` and picks the shape at call time. When a C API signature moves
upstream, that is the pattern: probe, do not `#ifdef` on a version you cannot
see.

**Mixed-type bit-fields lay out differently on MSVC vs GCC/Clang.** Upstream's
`LiteRtLayout` packs `dimensions[]` at offset 8 under MSVC and offset 4 under
GCC/Clang. Our bindings carry both `LiteRtLayoutMsvc` and `LiteRtLayoutPosix`
and pick per platform (`packages/flutter_gemma_litertlm/lib/src/ffi/litert_bindings.dart`).
Any new struct that mixes types inside a bit-field needs the same treatment —
check the layout, do not assume one.

**Exceptions across a shared-library boundary.** The Intel OpenVino dispatch is
built with `-fexceptions` **and** `-fno-unwind-tables
-fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables`. Do not rely on an exception escaping such a
`.so`/`.dll`; return a status instead. Note the flags are per-target — one
target in a package can have them while its sibling does not, so read the
`copts` of the target you are actually changing.

**Symbol visibility is opt-in per platform.** Linux exports via
`-Wl,--dynamic-list=…`, Windows via `/DEF:windows_exports.def`, both injected by
`patch_c_api.sh` §1. `-fvisibility=hidden` is wrong here: the WebGPU accelerator
resolves our symbols with `dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT)`. Adding an exported function
means adding it to the export list too, or it resolves to null at runtime with no
build error.

**macOS/iOS need `-Wl,-headerpad_max_install_names`.** Native Assets re-runs
`install_name_tool -id @rpath/…` on every `pub get`; without headerpad the
rewrite fails with "larger updated load commands do not fit" and `pub get`
aborts. This shipped to users once, in 0.14.1.

## How to verify native work

A build succeeding proves almost nothing here, because the failure modes are all
at load time. Assert the artifact:

```bash
# the symbol is exported (Linux/macOS)
nm -gU <lib> | grep <symbol>
# what it will try to load at runtime
otool -L <dylib>        # macOS
readelf -d <so> | head  # Linux
dumpbin /dependents <dll>   # Windows
# and that the file is what you think it is
file <lib>
```

`nm` on a path that does not exist prints nothing and exits 0, so a `grep -c`
over it returns `0` — indistinguishable from "symbol absent". Confirm the file
exists first. The `build-native` skill's checklist is the fuller version of this
and is where the project's native verification rules live; read it before
touching anything under `native/`.

## Output

Lead with the diagnosis and the evidence for it (a symbol table, a load-command
dump, a struct offset), then the change. When you cannot prove a claim from the
tree, say which command you would run to prove it rather than asserting it.
