/// Web integration test for `WebSqliteVectorStore` (rag_sqlite 1.3.0+).
///
/// Run with:
///   chromedriver --port=4444 &
///   cd packages/flutter_gemma/example
///   flutter drive \
///     --driver=test_driver/integration_test.dart \
///     --target=integration_test/rag_sqlite_web_store_test.dart \
///     -d chrome
///
/// For headless CI: `-d web-server` instead of `-d chrome`.
///
/// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
///
/// 1.2.0 shipped three defects on BOTH arms. 1.3.0 fixed all three on each
/// side in one change; what it did not have was any way to notice the web half — a re-initialize inheriting the
/// previous database's vector width, a swallowed detection error that let the
/// store report ready over a corpus it could not read, and a `close()` gated on
/// a flag the failure path clears. Four review passes found them; no test did,
/// because this package had no browser suite at all while declaring `web` a
/// supported platform.
///
/// The two tests below are the web twins of the native ones in
/// `flutter_gemma_rag_sqlite/test/sqlite_vector_store_test.dart`, and both fail
/// against the 1.2.0 web arm.
///
/// The wasm this drives is the example's own `web/rag/sqlite3.wasm` — the
/// vec0-linked build the package ships and asks apps to copy — so this also
/// covers the copy actually being in place.
