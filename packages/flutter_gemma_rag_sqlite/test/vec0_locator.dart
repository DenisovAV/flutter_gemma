// Locates the prebuilt vec0 loadable extension for host-side tests.
//
// Every suite here needs the same artifact, and each used to spell the lookup
// itself — one defaulting to `/tmp/vec0_poc/vec0.dylib`, a path left over from
// the migration proof-of-concept. Nothing puts a file there, so the keystone
// test was red on every machine where someone had not hand-downloaded one, and
// 23 more suites skipped themselves for the same reason. Since CI ran only
// packages/flutter_gemma, nobody saw either.
//
// The artifact is fetched by hook/build.dart into the shared download cache
// (`<cache>/sqlite_vec/<plat>/`), so that is the first place to look; a local
// `native/sqlite_vec/prebuilt/<plat>/` from build_local.sh comes next.
// $VEC0_DYLIB still wins, for pointing at a different build.
//
// NOTE this is the opposite of the hook's order, which prefers the local
// prebuilt (see `_resolveLibDir`). Core's shared helper puts the cache first
// deliberately — `host_native_library.dart` records that a stale local copy
// silently shadowing a refreshed download cost an incident. So on a machine
// holding both, `flutter test` exercises the checksum-verified release bytes
// while `flutter build` registers the local ones. The hook now says so on
// stderr when it takes the local path; do not read the two orders as agreeing.
//
// Naming the cache is not optional decoration: `flutter test` gets no Native
// Assets bundling, so this list IS how the suites find the library. When the
// loadables moved out of the package and this still said there was no cache to
// search, every store suite skipped itself and only the keystone gate noticed.
