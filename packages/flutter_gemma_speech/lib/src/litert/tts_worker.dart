// Long-lived background isolate that owns the entire Matcha-TTS pipeline:
// both the text frontend (dictionary G2P + host embedding gather, Task 2.2)
// and the native LiteRT core (4 compiled graphs + the CFM/vocoder forward
// passes, Task 2.3). The forward passes are blocking synchronous FFI calls;
// running them (and the frontend's dictionary lookups + 275k-entry load)
// here keeps the UI isolate's event loop free. Direct analog of
// `stt_worker.dart` — see that file's header for the "why a long-lived
// worker and not `Isolate.run`" rationale (FFI handles can't cross isolate
// boundaries; the compiled models are expensive to build but cheap to run).
//
// Unlike `SttWorker` (which owns only `SttCore`, tokenizer included inside
// the core), this worker owns TWO objects: `TtsTextFrontend` and `TtsCore`.
// Setup loads both plus a `TtsTextNormalizer` (for `splitClauses`, needs no
// symbols). Each request splits `text` into clauses so the CFM decoder's
// `MAX_MEL` cap (and its perceptual quality — the model was trained on
// clause-length utterances) doesn't get exceeded by long replies: every
// clause is `frontend.encodeChunks`d (itself possibly >1 sub-chunk, for a
// clause too long to fit MAX_TEXT at a word boundary) and each resulting
// input is `core.synthesize`d with its own CFM seed (`ttsCfmSeed +
// clauseIndex`, so a single-clause single-chunk request's seed is
// unchanged). ALL resulting PCM segments — across clauses AND across a
// clause's own sub-chunks — are spliced with the same short silence gap
// (`concatPcmWithSilence`, `tts_chunk.dart`): the inter-clause gap is the
// intended pause, while an inter-sub-chunk gap (only for a pathological
// over-long clause, a MAX_TEXT split) is an acceptable ~0.12 s mid-sentence
// pause — unlike the MAX_MEL split inside `TtsCore.synthesize`, which is
// seamless (`TtsCore.concatSegments`, no silence). Only `TtsCore` holds
// native handles, so only `core.dispose()` runs in the teardown `finally`.
//
// Only sendable values cross the port: file paths + profile + backend
// (setup), a `String` (request), and a `Uint8List` of 16-bit PCM samples
// (reply).
//
// `_workerEntry` branches on `init.profile.pipeline` (Task 5.3) into
// `_runMatchaWorker` (the above, unchanged) or `_runQwen3Worker`: Qwen3-TTS
// is a from-scratch autoregressive codec-token LM (`Qwen3TtsCore`, Phase
// 2-4) with its own KV cache and no CFM step, so it needs neither
// `TtsTextFrontend`/`TtsTextNormalizer` (Matcha's dictionary G2P + host
// embedding gather + clause splitter) nor `TtsCore` (Matcha's native
// core) — it does its own byte-level BPE tokenization
// (`Qwen2BpeEncoder`, inside `Qwen3TtsCore`) and consumes a request's full
// text in ONE AR pass (no clause-splitting, no per-clause CFM seed, no
// inter-clause silence — see `_runQwen3Worker`'s doc for why those three
// Matcha-specific behaviors don't apply here).
