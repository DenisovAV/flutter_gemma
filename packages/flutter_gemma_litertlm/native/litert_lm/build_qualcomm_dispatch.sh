# Build libLiteRtDispatch_Qualcomm.so for Android arm64 from LiteRT source.
#
# Requires the Qualcomm QNN dispatch bridge between LiteRT-LM and the on-device
# QNN/HTP runtime. This lib is NOT shipped in official LiteRT releases as of
# LiteRT v2.1.5 — we build it from source.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Bazel (via bazelisk): brew install bazelisk
#   - Android NDK at ~/Library/Android/sdk/ndk/<version>/
#   - Internet access (Bazel auto-downloads QAIRT SDK ~500MB on first run)
#     OR set LITERT_QAIRT_SDK=/path/to/qairt/2.44.0.260225 to use local copy
#
# Usage:
#   ./build_qualcomm_dispatch.sh
#   LITERTLM_REF=<sha> ./build_qualcomm_dispatch.sh          # match a specific engine build
#   LITERT_QAIRT_SDK=/path/to/qairt/2.44.0.260225 ./build_qualcomm_dispatch.sh
#
# Env:
#   LITERTLM_REF      LiteRT-LM commit to derive LITERT_REF from (default below).
#   LITERT_REF        Override the derived LiteRT ref. Rarely correct — the two
#                     must come from one tree or the dispatch SIGSEGVs.
#   LITERT_QAIRT_SDK  Local QAIRT SDK, skips the ~500 MB download.
#   ANDROID_NDK_HOME  NDK r29+ (auto-detected from ~/Library/Android/sdk/ndk).

# The dispatch library must be built from the SAME LiteRT tree as the engine it
# calls into. Hardcoding a ref here is how it silently drifted: this file sat at
# 5c5b9ce6 (LiteRT-LM ffed38ad, native-v0.12.0) while the engine moved on, and a
# stale dispatch does not fail politely — on v0.16.0 it SIGSEGVs inside
# LiteRtDestroyOptions the moment engine_create tears an options object down.
#
# So derive it instead: read LITERT_REF out of the WORKSPACE of the LiteRT-LM
# revision we are building. Pass LITERTLM_REF to match a specific engine build.
#
# Do NOT go back to a literal, and do NOT use LiteRT v2.1.1 or earlier — the
# LiteRtDispatchApi struct has breaking ABI changes after it.

# 2. Build dispatch lib.
#
# The NDK path goes in via --repo_env, NOT --action_env. At this pin LiteRT
# resolves the toolchain through rules_android_ndk and gates it on a repository
# rule: check_android_ndk_env() reads ctx.getenv("ANDROID_NDK_HOME") and, when
# it comes back empty, registers @android_ndk_env//:all — a repo with an EMPTY
# BUILD file. Zero toolchains, cc resolution finds nothing, Bazel falls back to
# the legacy crosstool, and you get `clang: error: unknown argument:
# '-gcc-toolchain'` — which reads as "NDK too new" and is not.
#
# --action_env populates action environments, which repo rules never read. The
# old .litert_configure.bazelrc written here (ANDROID_NDK_API_LEVEL and
# friends) was the pre-rules_android_ndk mechanism and is dead weight now:
# api_level is declared in LiteRT's own WORKSPACE call.
#
# LITERT_QAIRT_SDK rides the same rule: it is read by a repository rule, so
# exporting it does nothing. Without this line the script printed "(local)" and
# then downloaded the 500 MB SDK anyway.
