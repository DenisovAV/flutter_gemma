// The engine-specific forward-pass seam for the runtime-agnostic embedder
// (design: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-17-flutter-gemma-onnx-engine-design.md
// §2, §11 D3/D4).
//
// `flutter_gemma_embeddings` owns tokenization, TaskType prefixing, and
// pooling/normalization (see `pooling.dart`); the ONLY thing an inference
// engine (LiteRT-LM, ONNX, ...) supplies is the raw forward pass over
// already-tokenized input. This file defines that seam.
//
// Lifecycle is ASYNC (`Future<void> load()`, not a sync constructor) because
// every real forward-pass implementation loads/compiles a native model from
// disk — e.g. `litert_embedding_core.dart`'s `EmbeddingCore.load()` takes
// ~570-780ms. A sync API would force that work onto whichever isolate calls
// the constructor; async lets an off-main-isolate host (see
// `litert_embedding_worker.dart`'s pattern) `await` it inside the worker.

/// One engine's forward-pass implementation.
///
/// An instance is built and lives inside a single isolate — see
/// [ForwardPassDescriptor] for how the *ability to build one* crosses an
/// isolate boundary. Once built, the SAME isolate that called [load] must be
/// the one that calls [run] and [close]: the concrete implementation owns
/// native (FFI) handles that cannot themselves cross isolates.

///
/// **Why it must be a tear-off, not a closure or a registry:**
/// [ForwardPassDescriptor] carrying this factory is sent through a
/// [SendPort] into a freshly [Isolate.spawn]'d isolate (see
/// `IsolateForwardHost` in engine packages, and
/// `test/forward_pass_isolate_test.dart` for the boundary proof). Isolates
/// do not share mutable state — no shared statics, no captured closures —
/// they only share the compiled *code* of the program (in AOT, the same
/// binary; in JIT, the same loaded kernel). Dart's isolate messaging allows
/// sending values that *denote* code rather than *capture* it:
///  - A top-level/static function tear-off denotes "the function declared at
///    this source location." That declaration exists, unchanged, in the
///    fresh isolate's copy of the program, so the receiving isolate can
///    invoke it immediately — nothing needs to be reconstructed.
///  - A closure over local/instance state is either rejected outright by
///    isolate messaging, or (if it captured only sendable values) would
///    silently NOT carry the mutable object identity the closure's author
///    expected — a correctness trap.
///  - A runtime registry (e.g. a `Map<String, EmbeddingForwardPassFactory>`
///    populated via some `register()` call in the main isolate) is equally
///    unusable: a freshly spawned isolate starts from the *initial* static
///    state of the program, so the registry would be empty inside the
///    worker no matter what the main isolate had registered into it before
///    spawning — top-level/static state is NOT shared across isolates,
///    only re-initialized identically in each.
