# Flutter Gemma Desktop Support

Detailed setup and reference for running Flutter Gemma on **macOS, Windows, and Linux**.

> **FFI architecture**: desktop platforms run LiteRT-LM **directly via `dart:ffi`**. The previous Kotlin/JVM gRPC server (`litertlm-server.jar` + Azul Zulu JRE) is gone — no Java required, no separate process, no IPC overhead. Engine startup is ~2 s instead of ~10–15 s.

**Native libraries** are fetched at build time by `hook/build.dart` from the
GitHub release `native-v0.14.0`, SHA256-verified, and bundled by Flutter
[Native Assets](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/platform-integration/c-interop)
into the application bundle. End-users only need to add a small
`post_install` snippet to their **macOS** `Podfile` so the upstream companion
dylibs get wrapped into `.framework` bundles (and re-signed) inside the app's
`Contents/Frameworks/` for LiteRT-LM's `gpu_registry` to find them — see
[macOS setup in the README](README.md#macos-setup) for the exact block.
Linux and Windows are fully self-contained (no manual setup).

The Dart FFI layer is shared with mobile — Android and iOS use the same
`LiteRtLmFfiClient` against the same C API. Only the dynamic library
loading sequence differs per platform (handled in `litert_lm_client.dart`).

> **⚠️ Model format**
>
> Desktop accepts only LiteRT-LM `.litertlm` files. MediaPipe `.bin` / `.task`
> models used on web won't load on desktop. See
> [AI Edge Model Garden](https://ai.google.dev/edge/litert/models) for compatible models.

## Quick Start

```yaml
# pubspec.yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_gemma: ^1.3.2            # core
  flutter_gemma_litertlm: ^1.2.0   # .litertlm engine — required on desktop
```

```dart
import 'package:flutter_gemma/flutter_gemma.dart';
import 'package:flutter_gemma_litertlm/flutter_gemma_litertlm.dart';

Future<void> chat() async {
  // Register the LiteRT-LM engine (desktop is .litertlm only).
  FlutterGemma.initialize(inferenceEngines: const [LiteRtLmEngine()]);

  // Install model (downloads on first run, cached after).
  await FlutterGemma.installModel(
    modelType: ModelType.gemma4,
    fileType: ModelFileType.litertlm,
  ).fromNetwork(
    'https://huggingface.co/litert-community/gemma-4-E2B-it-litert-lm/resolve/main/gemma-4-E2B-it.litertlm',
    token: 'hf_...',
  ).install();

  // Create model with full capabilities — keep it for the app's lifetime.
  final model = await FlutterGemma.getActiveModel(
    maxTokens: 4096,
    preferredBackend: PreferredBackend.gpu,
    supportImage: true,
    supportAudio: true,
  );

  // Each chat / conversation is a session. Sessions are cheap to create
  // and destroy; the engine is reused across them.
  final session = await model.createSession(temperature: 0.8, topK: 1);
  await session.addQueryChunk(Message(text: 'Hi!', isUser: true));
  await for (final chunk in session.getResponseAsync()) {
    print(chunk);
  }
  await session.close();
}
```

For the high-level chat API with history + thinking + tool calling, use
`model.createChat(...)` and `chat.generateChatResponseAsync()`. See
[`example/`](example/) for a complete app.

## Platform-Specific Setup

### macOS

Native libs are fetched and bundled automatically via Native Assets. The
**only manual step** is adding a `post_install` block to your app's
`macos/Podfile` so the upstream companion dylibs get wrapped into
`.framework` bundles (and re-signed) inside `Contents/Frameworks/`, and
`LiteRtLm.dylib`'s `LC_LOAD_DYLIB` reference is re-pointed at the new
framework path (LiteRT-LM's `gpu_registry` resolves the Metal accelerator
through that framework). See the
[macOS setup snippet in the README](README.md#macos-setup) for the exact
block. Without it `engine_create` returns null on `PreferredBackend.gpu`
and the model silently falls back to CPU.

**Entitlements** required for the LLM to load weights and run inference:

`example/macos/Runner/DebugProfile.entitlements` and `Release.entitlements`:

```xml
<key>com.apple.security.network.client</key>
<true/>
<key>com.apple.security.app-sandbox</key>
<true/>
```

If your app needs to download models from network at runtime, add
`com.apple.security.network.client`. Otherwise app-sandbox alone is enough.

For large models (≥1 GB) you may want
[`com.apple.developer.kernel.extended-virtual-addressing`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com_apple_developer_kernel_extended-virtual-addressing)
and `com.apple.developer.kernel.increased-memory-limit`.

### Windows

`flutter_gemma` bundles every required DLL — no manual setup. The bundle
includes:

- `LiteRtLm.dll`, `LiteRt.dll`, `libGemmaModelConstraintProvider.dll`
- `libLiteRtWebGpuAccelerator.dll`, `libLiteRtTopKWebGpuSampler.dll`
- `webgpu_dawn.dll` (Dawn WebGPU backend — split into a shared lib in LiteRT-LM v0.14.0; the accelerator DLL imports it, so GPU fails without it)
- `dxil.dll` + `dxcompiler.dll` (DirectX Shader Compiler runtime — required for WebGPU/DX12 shader compilation; sourced from
  [microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler v1.9.2602](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/releases/tag/v1.9.2602))

`StreamProxy.dll` exposes a `LoadLibraryExA(LOAD_WITH_ALTERED_SEARCH_PATH)`
helper that the plugin uses to pre-load `libLiteRt.dll`, `libLiteRtWebGpuAccelerator.dll`,
and `libLiteRtTopKWebGpuSampler.dll` before opening `LiteRtLm.dll`. Without
this, modern Windows DLL search order doesn't always include the application
directory for secondary `LoadLibrary` calls made by `gpu_registry.cc` /
`sampler_factory.cc` at runtime — they would fail to find the GPU accelerator
DLL and silently fall back to CPU. (Mirrors the Linux `RTLD_GLOBAL` pattern.)

Make sure your end-users have the **Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2019+**
installed; LLM DLLs depend on its `vcruntime140.dll`/`msvcp140.dll`. Most modern
Windows 10/11 systems already have it; for distribution see
[the official redistributable download](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).

### Linux

The bundle includes:

- `libLiteRtLm.so`, `libLiteRt.so`, `libGemmaModelConstraintProvider.so`
- `libLiteRtWebGpuAccelerator.so`, `libLiteRtTopKWebGpuSampler.so`, `libStreamProxy.so`
- `libwebgpu_dawn.so` (Dawn WebGPU backend — split into a shared lib in LiteRT-LM v0.14.0; the accelerator loads it via `$ORIGIN` rpath, so GPU fails without it)

`libStreamProxy.so` is a tiny helper that exposes `stream_proxy_load_global`
(an `RTLD_GLOBAL` `dlopen`). The plugin uses it to pre-load `libLiteRt.so`
before `libLiteRtLm.so` so the WebGPU accelerator's runtime
`dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT, "LiteRt*")` resolves — without `RTLD_GLOBAL` Dart's
default `RTLD_LOCAL` would hide the symbols. The Windows variant of the
same helper (`StreamProxy.dll` → `LoadLibraryExA`) plays the equivalent
role on Windows; macOS dyld auto-resolves by basename so no helper is
needed there.

Linux GPU uses Dawn/WebGPU on top of Vulkan, so you need a working Vulkan
driver. On NVIDIA install the proprietary driver; on Intel/AMD the open-source
Mesa driver works out of the box on most distros.

For headless / server-side use (no display), `Xvfb` is enough as a fake
display surrogate — Flutter Linux integration tests run that way.

---

## Model Lifecycle

This applies to all desktop platforms; understanding it avoids the most
common runtime issues.

### One model, many sessions

The recommended (and only well-supported) pattern is:

```dart
// At app startup, ONCE:
final model = await FlutterGemma.getActiveModel(
  maxTokens: 4096,
  preferredBackend: PreferredBackend.gpu,
  supportImage: true,
  supportAudio: true,
);

// During app runtime, MANY TIMES:
final session = await model.createSession(...);
// ... chat, generate, etc.
await session.close();   // cheap

// At app shutdown:
await model.close();
```

Sessions are cheap to create/destroy. The expensive part is `engine_create`
(2–10 s depending on backend and model size), which happens once when the
model is first opened.

### Why not "one model per chat"?

Upstream LiteRT-LM keeps `LiteRtEnvironment` as a **process singleton** for
GPU paths (see comment in `runtime/core/engine_impl.cc` referencing `b/454383477`).
Once the env is initialized with the first model's settings — `cache_dir`,
backend, capabilities — those become process-fixed. Trying to recreate the
engine with different settings results in conflicts in the GPU stack
(notably a `wgpu::Instance already set` from the WebGpu sampler binary on
Linux/Windows).

The plugin avoids this by:

1. Reusing the same `InferenceModel` whenever requested params match (built-in singleton in `FlutterGemmaDesktop.createModel`).
2. Disabling GPU sampler preload on Linux so the upstream sampler factory falls back to a CPU sampler — eliminates the `wgpu::Instance` conflict and re-enables runtime model swap on Linux GPU.

If you do need to swap models at runtime, call `model.close()` first, then
`getActiveModel(...)` again with the new active model's spec. On Linux, this
works thanks to the CPU-sampler fallback above; on macOS / Windows it works
because their per-token sampling already runs on CPU (see Known Limitations
below).

### Switching backend (CPU ↔ GPU)

Same as switching model — close, then reopen with the new `preferredBackend`.

---

## Known Limitations

### Windows discrete GPU crashes (litertlm 1.2.0 / LiteRT-LM v0.14.0)

Windows **discrete GPUs** crash in the upstream WebGPU/Dawn stack on
`PreferredBackend.gpu` ([LiteRT-LM #2957](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/LiteRT-LM/issues/2957)).
Use `PreferredBackend.cpu` or `.npu` on Windows until upstream fixes it.
macOS/Linux GPU and Windows CPU/NPU are unaffected.

### Per-token sampler runs on CPU on all desktop platforms

When `preferredBackend: PreferredBackend.gpu`, the **forward pass** (prefill +
decode) runs on the GPU accelerator (Metal, DX12, Vulkan). The **per-token
sampler** (top-k / top-p / argmax) runs on CPU. Cost is roughly 1–5 ms per
token vs. full LLM generation, which is dominated by the forward pass.

Why this is the case:

- **macOS, Windows** — upstream `libLiteRtTopKMetalSampler` /
  `libLiteRtTopKWebGpuSampler` ship with incomplete C ABI exports (3 of 7
  functions). LiteRT-LM's sampler factory falls back to the static / CPU chain.
  - [google-ai-edge/LiteRT-LM #1990](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/LiteRT-LM/issues/1990) — Metal sampler missing/incomplete prebuilt
  - [google-ai-edge/LiteRT-LM #2073](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/LiteRT-LM/issues/2073) — WebGpu sampler exports only 3/7 functions on macOS/Windows
- **Linux** — the prebuilt `libLiteRtTopKWebGpuSampler.so` holds a
  process-static `wgpu::Instance` that any second `engine_create` rejects with
  `ALREADY_EXISTS: wgpu::Instance already set`. Since runtime model swap is
  more important than the few ms saved by GPU sampling, the plugin
  intentionally does not preload the sampler `.so` and lets the factory fall
  back to CPU.
  - [google-ai-edge/LiteRT #3133](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/LiteRT/issues/3133) — "MLDrift fails running second model" (closed; upstream confirms env singleton is intentional)
  - [google-ai-edge/LiteRT-LM #966](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/LiteRT-LM/issues/966) — community ask for the one-engine-many-sessions pattern

Once upstream lands the missing exports / a wgpu reset API, the plugin will
re-enable GPU sampling on the affected platforms.

### `randomSeed` / `temperature` / `topK` / `topP` honoring

As of litertlm 1.2.0 (LiteRT-LM **v0.14.0**), per-session sampler params
(seed / temperature / topK / topP) are honored **natively** by the upstream
runtime through its opaque session config — no downstream patch. Each session
carries its own sampler params, so two sessions with different seeds produce
independent, seed-reproducible output. Verified on CPU and GPU across macOS,
iOS, Linux, Windows (CPU/NPU), and Android.

> Earlier releases (≤ litertlm 1.1.0) needed a build-time downstream patch
> (`native/litert_lm/patch_c_api.sh`, offered upstream as
> [#2080](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/LiteRT-LM/issues/2080) /
> [PR #2081](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/LiteRT-LM/pull/2081)) because the
> stock executor hardcoded sampler params on the GPU/NPU path. v0.14.0 lands the
> native session-config sampler, so that patch is no longer applied.

Reproducer: `flutter test integration_test/regression_bugs_test.dart` on any
platform — `randomSeed=42` vs `randomSeed=99` at `temperature=1.0`.

### Audio modality requires LiteRT-LM models

Audio input only works with `.litertlm` models that include the audio adapter
(Gemma 3n E2B/E4B, Gemma 4 E2B/E4B). MediaPipe `.task` models on web don't
support audio.

### iOS Simulator: GPU disabled

iOS Simulator's Metal has a 256 MB single-allocation cap that LLM weight
tensors exceed (Gemma 3 1B's KV cache alone is 288 MB). Use CPU on the
simulator, or test on a physical iPhone for GPU validation.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Engine create fails with no native log on Linux

In **debug builds** the plugin redirects native stderr to
`<tmpdir>/litertlm_native.log` and dumps it via `debugPrint` after a failed
`engine_create`. If you don't see a dump, set `defaultTargetPlatform == TargetPlatform.linux` and run in `flutter run --debug`.

In release builds stderr goes to systemd journal / app's own stderr — check
your distribution's log facility.

### `glibc 2.38 not found` on Linux

The current bundle is built against glibc 2.34 (Ubuntu 22.04 toolchain). If
you see this error on a stock Ubuntu 22.04 system you're hitting a stale
local binary in `native/litert_lm/prebuilt/linux_x86_64/`. Clear it:

```bash
rm -rf native/litert_lm/prebuilt/linux_x86_64/
flutter clean && flutter run
```

`hook/build.dart` will fetch the correct glibc-2.34 binary from the GitHub
release on next run.

### Windows GPU shaders fail to compile

Symptom: `engine_create` returns null with no Dart-side error, app silently
falls back to CPU.

Verify `dxcompiler.dll` and `dxil.dll` are next to your `app.exe`. They should
be — Native Assets bundles them. If they're absent, the WebGPU/DX12 shader
compiler can't run.

If they're present but still failing, check that the user's Windows has the
[VS 2019+ Visual C++ Runtime](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).

### Model file not found / `Cannot find: gemma-...litertlm`

On all desktop platforms the model is downloaded to the platform's standard
"app support" directory:

- macOS: `~/Library/Containers/<bundle-id>/Data/Documents/`
- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\<app-name>\`
- Linux: `~/.local/share/<bundle-id>/`

Use `FlutterGemma.installModel(...).fromNetwork(...).install()` to download,
or `.fromFile(absolutePath)` if you already have it locally.

### Pre-cached engine + new code = stale cache

LiteRT-LM caches compiled GPU shaders next to the model file
(`<model>.litertlm_<random>_mldrift_program_cache.bin`). After upgrading the
plugin or the model, delete that file and the engine will rebuild the cache
on first run.

## API Reference

`FlutterGemma`, `InferenceModel`, `InferenceModelSession`, `InferenceChat` —
all platform-agnostic. See `lib/flutter_gemma_interface.dart` and the
[example app](example/) for usage patterns.

For native debugging on iOS / Linux, see comments in
`flutter_gemma_litertlm/lib/src/ffi/litert_lm_client.dart` (search for `stream_proxy_redirect_stderr`
and `_dumpNativeLog`).
