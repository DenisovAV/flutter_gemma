// What happens when someone ELSE poisons the process — the case we cannot
// prevent, only diagnose.
//
// The other #447 tests all run in a process where our own load order wins. This
// one covers the residual case: app or third-party code opens libLiteRtLm
// locally before flutter_gemma runs at all (a plain `DynamicLibrary.open`, or a
// Java `System.loadLibrary`, which is RTLD_NOW *without* RTLD_GLOBAL). bionic
// never promotes, so the condition is permanent and our fix cannot repair it.
//
// The contract, then, is not "keep working" — it is:
//
//   * `.litertlm` generation FAILS LOUDLY instead of producing corrupt text
//   * embeddings and speech KEEP WORKING, because they resolve through their
//     own handle and never needed the symbols to be ambient
//
// Those two branches are the whole of the warn/require split, and nothing else
// in the suite reaches either of them: every other test runs in a process where
// the preload takes.
//
// The poisoning is done from the test body, which is a faithful stand-in — what
// matters is that it comes from outside the code under test, not that it comes
// from another app.
//
// MUST run as its own process: the poisoning is irreversible.
