// The ENQUEUE end of #445.
//
// Every other test in this directory watches the listen end — that updates
// reach us and not the host. None of them could see the other half: mutation
// testing showed that changing the enqueued task's `group`, or reverting
// `priority` to 10, or dropping progress updates, left the entire 636-test
// suite green.
//
// The group is the worst of those. `registerCallbacks(group:)` and the task's
// `group:` are two ends of one wire; if they drift, the task lands in a group
// nobody is registered for, background_downloader logs a warning nobody reads,
// and the download hangs forever. Both ends are pinned here to the SAME
// constant, which is what makes this a drift test rather than a tautology.
