// #447 as a USER sees it: embed something, then generate.
//
// The companion loader_order tests measure symbol visibility from Dart. That is
// a proxy. The failure reported in #447 is a stream that delivers ZERO chunks,
// synthesises `Exception: Stream error: <U+FFFD>` out of unread registers, and
// then aborts the process with SIGABRT when the closed NativeCallable is
// invoked again. This file reproduces THAT, or shows that it cannot be
// reproduced this way — which would mean the load-order explanation is not the
// one behind #447 and the fix has to be the native one.
//
// Order is the whole point. Our canonical suite (litertlm_ffi_test.dart) runs
// the embedding group LAST, so the failing permutation is not expressible in
// it and never has been.
//
// Needs both models pushed to the device:
//   adb push gemma-4-E2B-it.litertlm  /data/local/tmp/flutter_gemma_test/
//   adb push embeddinggemma-300M_seq256_mixed-precision.tflite  ...
//   adb push sentencepiece.model  ...
//
//   flutter test integration_test/embed_then_generate_447_test.dart -d <android>
