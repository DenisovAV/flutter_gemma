"""Every symbol an Android library imports must be reachable through its own
DT_NEEDED chain.

Bionic gives each library its own namespace view: an undefined symbol resolves
only against the libraries in that library's NEEDED closure, never against
whatever else happens to be loaded in the process. A GLOBAL import that misses
fails dlopen. A WEAK one does not fail anything — it binds to NULL, dlopen
succeeds, and the process jumps to address 0 the first time a code path calls
it. That is #545: the v0.17.0 OpenCL accelerator imports AHardwareBuffer_*
weakly without libandroid.so, and only Mali GPUs take the path that calls it.
#270 was the same rule broken by a sampler importing LiteRtCreateEnvironment
without libLiteRtLm.so.

For every aarch64 ELF in <bundle_dir>, each UND symbol is looked up in the NDK
platform stubs and in the bundle's own exports. If it has a provider and no
provider is in the library's NEEDED closure, that is a FAIL. Symbols with no
known provider are not ours to judge (absl leak-check hooks, gcov, …).

Usage: check_android_needed.py <bundle_dir>
NDK: $ANDROID_NDK_HOME / $ANDROID_NDK_ROOT, else the newest ndk/* under
$ANDROID_HOME, $ANDROID_SDK_ROOT, ~/Library/Android/sdk or ~/Android/Sdk.
