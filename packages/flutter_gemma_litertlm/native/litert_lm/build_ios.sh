# this, App Store Connect rejects the archive with ITMS-90208 ("framework
# does not support the minimum OS Version specified in the Info.plist")
# whenever a dylib's binary minos differs from the wrapper plist's 13.0.
#
# The declared floor is flutter_gemma's podspec `s.platform = :ios, '15.0'`
# (#441; 16.0 only for flutter_gemma_mediapipe) — that's the real contract.
# The minos here is just metadata to satisfy validator equality between binary
# and wrapper plist; the actual minimum is enforced by whichever dependency
# manager the app uses — SwiftPM against the Runner target on the default path,
# CocoaPods against the Podfile platform when the app has one.
