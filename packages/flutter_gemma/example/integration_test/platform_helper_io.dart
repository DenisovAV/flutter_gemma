/// Dart-level fixes (shouldOverrideUrlLoading, evaluateJavascript,
/// WebViewEnvironment.userDataFolder, our io arm) didn't change the crash, and a
/// minimal no-our-code headless test crashes identically, while the SAME code as
/// a `flutter run` app (with a real window) works. The loopback secure-context
/// is probe-proven on Windows WebView2 — only the test harness is incompatible —
/// so the L2 real-webview scenarios are skipped here, not failed.
