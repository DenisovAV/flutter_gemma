# The macOS `post_install` snippet lives in many places: three example Podfiles,
# every codelab step app that depends on the plugin, the core README (which is
# the pub.dev landing page users copy from) and the website. They must stay
# byte-identical.
#
# This is not tidiness. The snippet is frozen into every app's project.pbxproj
# at `pod install` time, and upgrading flutter_gemma_litertlm does NOT re-run
# `pod install` — the package declares no macOS plugin, so Flutter's tracked
# plugin set never changes. A fix that lands in one copy therefore never reaches
# users who copied another. When this check was written the five copies had
# already drifted into three vintages: the genkit example predated all three of
# the #300/#368 fixes, and the README copy — the one users actually paste — was
# missing `input_paths`, i.e. every app built from it carried the #368
# incremental-build bug.
#
# Usage: tool/check_macos_podfile_snippet.sh   (exit 1 on drift)
