// Set membership over a NUMBER-typed field must run, and must reach the KNN
// scan — it used to do neither.
//
// `FieldMatchAny` on a `FilterFieldType.number` field renders onto a vec0
// FLOAT column, and vec0 refuses `IN` on FLOAT/BOOLEAN kinds outright:
// `'xxx in (...)' is only available on INTEGER or TEXT metadata columns.`,
// raised out of sqlite3_prepare. So the filter did not narrow the search, it
// THREW — against a core contract that says an unmatched filter "simply
// matches nothing" and never errors.
//
// The trap underneath it is worse: SQLite folds `year = ? OR year = ?` into
// `year IN (?, ?)` on its own, for bound parameters as well as literals. A
// `should` bucket of plain `FieldEquals` on one number field therefore hit the
// same refusal without anyone writing `FieldMatchAny` at all.
//
// Both are asserted here on ROWS from a real vec0 table. The corpus is built so
// that the nearest rows do NOT match: a filter that vec0 never sees returns
// them and lets SQLite discard them afterwards, which yields fewer than k rows
// (usually zero) while reading as a filtered search. Only a filter pushed into
// the scan can reach past them.
